## Book of Books
- the countless conceivable possibilities
- Reality is a very subjective affair...You can get nearer and nearer, 
  so to speak, to reality; but you never get near enough because reality
  is an infinite succession of steps, levels of perception, false bottoms, and 
  hence unquenchable, unattainable.
- You can know more and more about one thing but you can never know everything about one thing: it's hopeless
- **To learn infinitely many things, we would only ever need perfect knowledge of one book**
- Every reading differs; every reading  offers something new
- It's impossible to dip into the same book twice.

# The Black Swan
Nassim Nicholas Taleb


- Black swan is an event with the following 3 attributes:
  - rarity
  - extreme impact
  - retrospective predicatability
- All you need is one single black bird

## Prologue

### On the plumage of birds
- a severe limitation to our learning from observations or experience and the fragility of our knowledge
- low predicatability and large impact
- **Life is the cumulative effect of a handful of significant shocks**

### What you do not know
- Black swan logic => what you don't know is far more relevant than what you know
- The payoff of a human venture is in general inversely proportional to what it is expected to be.

### Experts and "Empty suits"
- What you know cannot really hurt you
- We tend to learn the precise not the general
- Antiknowledge - what we don't know
### Learning to learn
- There are so many things we can do if we focus on Antiknowledge
- The built-in defect of conventional wisdom
- We don't learn rules, just facts only facts
- We do much less thinking than we believe we do

### A New kind of ingratitude
- Everybody knows that we need more prevention than treatment, but few reward acts of prevention


### Life is very unusual
- We humans are not just a superficial race, we are a very unfair one
- Indeed, the normal is often irrelevant

### Plato and the Nerd
- Platonicity => tendency to mistake the map for the territory
- Platonicity - what makes us think that we understand more than we actually do

### Too dull to write about
- Metaphors and stories are far more potent than ideas
- Ideas come and go, stories stay

### The Bottom Line
- It is the drive to "focus" on what makes sense to us
- Black swan idea - the structure of randomness in empirical reality
- Our world is dominated by the extreme, the unknown and the very improbable - and all the while
  we spend our time engaged in small talk, focusing on the known and the repeated
- Reality - wicked world / wicked environment
- Our focus - kind world / kind environment


## PART ONE: UMBERTO ECO' ANTILIBRARY, OR HOW WE SEEK VALIDATION
- ANTILIBRARY - collection of unread books
- We take what we know a little too seriously
- The error of confirmation: the tendency to look at what confirms our knowledge, not our ignorance
- Narrative fallacy: how we fool ourselves with stories and anecdotes

### Chapter 1: The Apprenticeship of an Empirical Skeptic
#### Anatomy of a Black swan
#### On walking walks
#### "Paradise" Evaporated
#### The Starred Night
#### History and the Triplet of Opacity
- The human mind sufferes from three ailments as it comes into contact with history called the triplet of Opacity. They are:
  - **the illusion of understanding** or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize
  - **the retrospective distortion** : or how we can assess matters only after the fact, as if they were a rearview mirror
  - **the overvaluation of factual information** and the handicap of authoritative and learned people, particularly when they create categories - when they Platonify
- History is opaque
- the pathology of thinking that the world in which we live is more understandable, more explainable and therefore more predictable  than it actually is
- Our minds are wonderful explanation machines and generally incapable of accepting the idea of unpredictability

#### History does not crawl, it jumps
- Retrospective plausibility causes a discounting of the rarity and conceivability of the event.
- We are just a great machine for looking backward

#### Dear Diary, on history running backward
- Humans are great at self-delusion
- It is not just knowledge but information that can be of dubious value

#### Education in a taxi cab 
- Platonicity - the desire to cut reality into crisp shapes
-  the mental contagion
- Categorizing is necessary for humans, but it becomes pathological when the category is seen as definitive
- the Platonic Fold - is where our representation of reality ceases to apply - but we do not know it
- epistemology - the philosophy of knowledge
- psychological buffer
- The problem lay not in the nature of events, but in the way we perceived them
- mental blindspot

### Chapter 2: Yegenia's Black Swan
- the confirmatory reinforcement of what we call "experience"

### Chapter 3: The Speculator and the Prostitude
- Extremistan => the Black-swan generating province
- Mediocristan => the tame, quiet and uneventful province
- scalable - production of concepts and ideas
- less scalable - noncreative technical grind
- Evolution is scalable
- Type 1 randomness - Matters in Mediocristan
- Type 2 randomness - Matters in Extremistan

### Chapter 4: One thousand and one days, or How not to be a sucker
- There are traps built into any kind of knowledge gained from observation
- We will incur a reversion of belief
- We worry too late
- Clearly you cannot manufacture more info than the past can deliver.
- The positive Black Swans take time to show their effect while negative ones happen very rapidly

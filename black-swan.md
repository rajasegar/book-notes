# The Black Swan
Nassim Nicholas Taleb


- Black swan is an event with the following 3 attributes:
  - rarity
  - extreme impact
  - retrospective predicatability
- All you need is one single black bird

## Prologue

### On the plumage of birds
- a severe limitation to our learning from observations or experience and the fragility of our knowledge
- low predicatability and large impact
- **Life is the cumulative effect of a handful of significant shocks**

### What you do not know
- Black swan logic => what you don't know is far more relevant than what you know
- The payoff of a human venture is in general inversely proportional to what it is expected to be.

### Experts and "Empty suits"
- What you know cannot really hurt you
- We tend to learn the precise not the general
- Antiknowledge - what we don't know
### Learning to learn
- There are so many things we can do if we focus on Antiknowledge
- The built-in defect of conventional wisdom
- We don't learn rules, just facts only facts
- We do much less thinking than we believe we do

### A New kind of ingratitude
- Everybody knows that we need more prevention than treatment, but few reward acts of prevention


### Life is very unusual
- We humans are not just a superficial race, we are a very unfair one
- Indeed, the normal is often irrelevant

### Plato and the Nerd
- Platonicity => tendency to mistake the map for the territory
- Platonicity - what makes us think that we understand more than we actually do

### Too dull to write about
- Metaphors and stories are far more potent than ideas
- Ideas come and go, stories stay

### The Bottom Line
- It is the drive to "focus" on what makes sense to us
- Black swan idea - the structure of randomness in empirical reality
- Our world is dominated by the extreme, the unknown and the very improbable - and all the while
  we spend our time engaged in small talk, focusing on the known and the repeated
- Reality - wicked world / wicked environment
- Our focus - kind world / kind environment


## PART ONE: UMBERTO ECO' ANTILIBRARY, OR HOW WE SEEK VALIDATION
- ANTILIBRARY - collection of unread books
- We take what we know a little too seriously
- The error of confirmation: the tendency to look at what confirms our knowledge, not our ignorance
- Narrative fallacy: how we fool ourselves with stories and anecdotes

### Chapter 1: The Apprenticeship of an Empirical Skeptic
#### Anatomy of a Black swan
#### On walking walks
#### "Paradise" Evaporated
#### The Starred Night
#### History and the Triplet of Opacity
- The human mind sufferes from three ailments as it comes into contact with history called the triplet of Opacity. They are:
  - **the illusion of understanding** or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize
  - **the retrospective distortion** : or how we can assess matters only after the fact, as if they were a rearview mirror
  - **the overvaluation of factual information** and the handicap of authoritative and learned people, particularly when they create categories - when they Platonify
- History is opaque
- the pathology of thinking that the world in which we live is more understandable, more explainable and therefore more predictable  than it actually is
- Our minds are wonderful explanation machines and generally incapable of accepting the idea of unpredictability

#### History does not crawl, it jumps
- Retrospective plausibility causes a discounting of the rarity and conceivability of the event.
- We are just a great machine for looking backward

#### Dear Diary, on history running backward
- Humans are great at self-delusion
- It is not just knowledge but information that can be of dubious value

#### Education in a taxi cab 
- Platonicity - the desire to cut reality into crisp shapes
-  the mental contagion
- Categorizing is necessary for humans, but it becomes pathological when the category is seen as definitive
- the Platonic Fold - is where our representation of reality ceases to apply - but we do not know it
- epistemology - the philosophy of knowledge
- psychological buffer
- The problem lay not in the nature of events, but in the way we perceived them
- mental blindspot

### Chapter 2: Yegenia's Black Swan
- the confirmatory reinforcement of what we call "experience"

### Chapter 3: The Speculator and the Prostitude
- Extremistan => the Black-swan generating province
- Mediocristan => the tame, quiet and uneventful province
- scalable - production of concepts and ideas
- less scalable - noncreative technical grind
- Evolution is scalable
- Type 1 randomness - Matters in Mediocristan
- Type 2 randomness - Matters in Extremistan

### Chapter 4: One thousand and one days, or How not to be a sucker
- There are traps built into any kind of knowledge gained from observation
- We will incur a reversion of belief
- We worry too late
- Clearly you cannot manufacture more info than the past can deliver.
- The positive Black Swans take time to show their effect while negative ones happen very rapidly
- It's easier and much faster to destroy than to build
- Asymmetry in timescales explains the difficulty in reversing time
- Systematically doubt everything => Pyrrhonian Skeptics
- fideism => the idea of relying on faith, not reason
- Erudition signals genuine intellectual curiosity
- The central difficulty of generalizing from available information or of learning from the past, the known and the seen.
- terminal difficulty
- **The error of confirmation**: We focus on preselected segments of the seen and generalize from it to the unseen
- **Narrative fallacy**: We fool ourselves with stories that cater to our Platonic thirst for distinct patterns
- **Distortion of silent evidence**: What we see is not necessarily all that is there. History hides Black Swans from us and gives usa mistaken idea about the odds of these events.

### Chapter 5: Confirmation Shmonfirmation
- Contrary to conventional wisdom, our body of knowledge does not increase from a series of confirmatory observations
- We are not immune to trivial logical errors
- Complicated equations do not tend to cohabit happily with clarity of mind
- **Our inferential machinery is not made for a complicated environment**
- Our statistical intuitions have not evolved for a habitat in which these subtleties can make a big difference.
- **We tend to use different mental machinery in different situations**
- Our brain lacks a central all-purpose computer that starts with logical rules and applies them equally to all possible situations
- simple kind of inferential confusion
- disconfirming evidence
- **Naive empiricism** => We have a natural tendency to look for instances that confirm our story and our vision of the world.
- It is misleading to build a general rule from observed facts
- We can get closer to the truth by negative instances not by verification.
- couterevidence
- semiskeptics
- **You know what is wrong with a lot more conviction than you know what is right.**
- The problem of naive generalization does not plague us everywhere.
- We are endowed with specific and elaborate inductive instincts showing us the way.
- We come equipped with mental machinery that causes us to selectively generalize from experience
- We may have learned things wrong from our ancestors.
- We probably inherited the instincts adequate for survival.
-
### Chatper 6: Narrative Fallacy
- We like stories, we like to summarize and we like to simplify i.e., to reduce the dimension of matters.
- **Problem of induction** => What lies outside our information set
- **Narrative fallacy** => What lies inside our information set
- Our vulnerability to overinterpretation of our predilection for compact stories over raw truths
- It severely distorts our mental representation of the world.
- We are stupid to Systematically try to explain skills.
- Our limited ability to look at sequences of facts without weaving an explanation into them.
- Causation trap
- forcing a logical link, an arrow of relationship
- The novelty fades and your thinking returns as usual
- **Explanations bind facts together**
- Narrativity comes from an ingrained biological need to reduce dimensionality
- It takes considerable effort to see facts while withholding judgement and resisting explanations.
- backfit and post hoc explanations
- It is impossible for our brain to see anything in raw form without some interpretation
- **We are better at explaining than understanding**

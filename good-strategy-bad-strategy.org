* Good Strategy Bad Strategy
Author: Richard Rumelt

** Introduction - Overwhelming Obstacles
- Good strategy is almost looks this simple and obvious
- Strategy is not:
	- ambition
	- determination
	- inspirational leadership
	- innovation
- Ambition is drive and zeal to excel
- Determination is commitment and grit
- Innovation is the discovery and engineering new ways to do things
- Pivot points => multiply the effectiveness of efforts
- Core of strategy work:
	- discovering the critical factors in a situation
	- designing a way of coordinating and focusing actions to deal with those factors
- *A good strategy recognizes the nature of the challenge and offers a way of surmounting it*
- *Simply being ambitious is not a strategy*
- A good strategy does more than urge us forward toward a goal or vision
- A good strategy honestly acknowledges the challenges being faced  and provides an approach to overcoming them
- Good strategy is the exception not the rule
- The plentitude has not bought clarity
- Strategy cannot be a useful concept if it is a synonym for success
- Strategy cannot be a useful tool if it is confused with ambition, determination, inspirational leadership and innovation
- Strategy is about how an organization move forward
- A good strategy includes a set of coherent actions
- A strategy that fails to define a variety of plausible and feasible immediate actions is missing a critical component.
- Doing strategy => figuring out how to advance the organization's interests
- Kernel => an essential logical structure of good strategy
	- diagnosis
	- guiding policy
	- coherent action
- The creeping of bad strategy affects us all
- wishful thinking
- Our education system is rich with targets and standards, but poor in comprehending and countering the sources of underperformance
- *A good strategy creates strength through the coherence of its design*

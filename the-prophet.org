* The Prophet
Author: Kahlil Gibran

** Love
- Love descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth
- The ways of love are hard and steep
- The voice of love may shatter your dreams
- When love beckons to you, follow him
- Loves gives nothing but itself and takes nothing but from itself.
- Love possesses not nor would it be possessed.

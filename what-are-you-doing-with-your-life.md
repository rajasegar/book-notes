# What are you doing with your life?
Author: J.Krishnamurti

- What is the good of learning, if in the process of living we are destroying ourselves?
- The world is not different from us, the world is us.
- Goodness is contagious.
- Even if one of us changes, it has a ripple effect.
- Maturity is not a matter of age, it is matter of understanding.
- Life is always in movement, never static. But our minds are static.

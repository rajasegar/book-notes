* Better
A Surgeon's Notes on Performance

Author: Atul Gawande

- We face obstacles of seemingly unending variety. Yet somehow we must advance, we must refine, we must improve
- The world is chaotic, disorganized and vexing
- easy and minor virtue
- *Diligence* - the necessity of giving sufficient attention to detail to avoid error and prevail against obstacles
- Diligence is both central to performance and fiendishly hard
- *ingenuity* -> thinking anew
- *Betterment is a perpetual labor*
- human failings:
  - avarice
  - arrogance
  - insecurity
  - misunderstanding
- When you make an effort, you find sometimes you are not the only one willing to do so

** Diligence
 - *We always hope for the easy fix: the one simple change that will erase a problem in a stroke*
 - Success requires making a hundred small steps go right one after the other, no slipups, no goofs, everyone pitching in
 - a problem of compliance - a failure of an individual to apply that know-how correctly
 - positive deviance from the norm
 - *The positive deviance idea* - the idea of building on capabilities people already had rather than telling them how they had to change
 - People underestimate the importance of diligence as a virtue
 - *Diligence* => supremely mundane
 - *Diligence* => the constant and earnest effort to accomplish what is undertaken
 - There is a flavor of simplistic relentlessness to diligence
 - narrow and unambitious
 - Diligence is the prerequisite of great accomplishment
 - Diligence sets a high seemingly impossible expectation for performance and human behavior
 - The world is too vast and too various to submit to dictates from on high
 - fond of grand-sounding pledges


 
** Doing Right

** Ingenuity

** Becoming a positive deviant:
 - Ask an unscripted question
 - Don't complain
 - Count something
 - Write something
 - Change

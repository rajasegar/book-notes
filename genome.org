* Genome
The AutoBiography of a Species in 23 chapters
Author: Matt Ridley

** Preface
- the unfolding story of human genome
- We are living through the greatest intellectual moment in history
- The human being is much more than his genes
- *We stand on the brink of great new answers but even more of great new questions*
- tedious biochemical middle managers
- Human beings accumulate about 100 mutations per generation.
- Modern genetics is a formidable thicket of jargon

** Life
- Human brain => porridgy contraption
- immense fascination
- *The secret of life is indeed a thread*
- *Life is a slippery thing to define*, but it consists of two very different skills
	- the ability to replicate
	- the ability to create order
- *Living creatures drink orderliness from the environment*
- Genes are coded recipes
- Chromosomes contain the secret of life
- The secret of life has nothing to do with quantum states
- DNA is the chemical manifestation of heredity
- *All life is chemistry*. Atleat some life is chemistry
- Life to the rough approximation consists of the chemistry of 3 atoms, H, C and O
- carbon based lifeforms
- It is the emergent properties of life like heritablity that are interesting.
- *Heredity is a modifiable stored program*
- *Metabolism is a universal machine*
- *The less entropy a system has, the more information it contains*
- Life is digital information written in DNA
- It is proteins that enable DNA to replicate
- Life consists of the interplay of two kinds of chemicals: proteins and DNA
- Ribosome - machine whose job is to translate DNA recipes into proteins
- There is a growing evidence that RNA cambe before proteins
- error catastrope - rapid decay of the message in the genes
- RNA is an unstable substance
- The surface life on earth is but a veneer
- LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor
- Life has a physical history but not a genealogical one
- The genes that ended up in all of us may therefore have come from lots of different species of creatures
- it paid to simplify the machinery
- We are all descended from society not from an individual species
- Bacteria are much more highly evolved than we are
- All life is one
- We all are exactly the same language
- *The unity of life is an empirical fact*
- One and the same kind of living filaments has been the cause of all organic life
- Large single celled creatures were probably the ancestors of bacteria, not vice versa

** Species
- Sometimes the obvious can stare you in the face
- The human species is by no means the pinnacle of evolution
- Evolution has no pinnacle
- There is no such thing as evolutionary progress
- Every species on the planet is unique
- *Uniqueness is a commodity in oversupply*
- Complexity is not everything
- *Complexity is not the goal of evolution*
- For a successful species, we are remarkably pessimistic about the future
- *Human beings are an ecological success*
- *The remarkable truth is that we come from a long line of failures*
- Our ecological success came against humbling odds
- The longer the animals existed, the more complex some of them became
- *The genes have found a way to delegate their ambitions*
- We are more chimpanzee like and than gorillas are
- *Evolution works not  in years but in generations*
- Human beigns went through a much tighter genetic bottleneck
- The ecology selected a dramatic change in our ancestral skeleton
- *We still know too little*
- The differences between us and other species are primarily genetic
- Every species behaves in a characteristic way
- *Genes are recipes for both anatomy and behavior*

* Genome
The AutoBiography of a Species in 23 chapters
Author: Matt Ridley

** Preface
- the unfolding story of human genome
- We are living through the greatest intellectual moment in history
- The human being is much more than his genes
- *We stand on the brink of great new answers but even more of great new questions*
- tedious biochemical middle managers
- Human beings accumulate about 100 mutations per generation.
- Modern genetics is a formidable thicket of jargon

** Life
- Human brain => porridgy contraption
- immense fascination
- *The secret of life is indeed a thread*
- *Life is a slippery thing to define*, but it consists of two very different skills
	- the ability to replicate
	- the ability to create order
- *Living creatures drink orderliness from the environment*
- Genes are coded recipes
- Chromosomes contain the secret of life
- The secret of life has nothing to do with quantum states
- DNA is the chemical manifestation of heredity
- *All life is chemistry*. Atleat some life is chemistry
- Life to the rough approximation consists of the chemistry of 3 atoms, H, C and O
- carbon based lifeforms
- It is the emergent properties of life like heritablity that are interesting.
- *Heredity is a modifiable stored program*
- *Metabolism is a universal machine*
- *The less entropy a system has, the more information it contains*
- Life is digital information written in DNA
- It is proteins that enable DNA to replicate
- Life consists of the interplay of two kinds of chemicals: proteins and DNA
- Ribosome - machine whose job is to translate DNA recipes into proteins
- There is a growing evidence that RNA cambe before proteins
- error catastrope - rapid decay of the message in the genes
- RNA is an unstable substance
- The surface life on earth is but a veneer

** Discipline
*** Problems and Pain
- When we avoid the legitimate suffering that results from dealing with problems, we also avoid the growth that problems demand us
- No suffering, no growth
- No pain, no gain
- No legitimate suffering, no spiritual growth
- Life is difficult
- Discipline is the basic set of tools we require to solve life's problems
- Life is a series of problems
- a unique kind of affliction
- the enormity of our problems
- Without discipline we can solve nothing
- With only some discipline we can solve only some problems
- With total discipline we can solve all problems
- Life poses an endless series of problems
- Life is always difficult and is full of pain as well as joy
- It is only because of problems that we grow mentally and spiritually
- It is through the pain of confronting and resolving problems that we learn
- Those things that hurt, instruct
- The tendency to avoid problems and the emotional suffering inherent in them is the primary basis of all human mental illness
- 4 Disciplines:
  - delaying of gratification
  - acceptance of responsibilities
  - dedication to truth
  - balancing
- Once we truly see the truth, we transcend it
- Once we truly know that life is difficult, once we truly understand and accept it, then life is no longer difficult
- *It is in the whole process of meeting and solving problems that life has its meaning*
- Problems are the cutting edge that distinguishes between success and failure
- Problems call forth our courage and wisdom
- When we desire to encourage the growth of the human spirit, we challenge and encourage the human capacity to solve problems
- Wise people learn not to dread but actually to welcome problems and actually to welcome the pain of problems
- We attempt to skirt around problems rather then meet them head on
- We attempt to get out of them rather than suffer through them

*** The Sins of the Father

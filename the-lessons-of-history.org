* The Lessons of History
Author: Will Durant

** Hesitations
 - History has no sense
 - Our knowledge of any past event is always incomplete, probably inaccurate, beclouded by ambivalent
	 evidence and biased historians and perhaps distored by our own patriotic or religious partisanships
 - A multitude of doubts assail our enterprise
 - *Most history is guessing and the rest is prejudice*
 - mutitudinous complexity
 - Historiography cannot be a science
 - *The present is the past rolled up for action and the past is the present unrolled for understanding*
 - Total perspective is an optical illusion
 - All formulas should be suspect
 - *The historian always oversimplifies and hastily selects a manageable minority of facts and faces out
	 of a crowd of souls and events show multitudinous complexity he can never quite embrace or comprehend*
 - We do not know the whole of man's history
 - *We must operate with partial knowledge and be provisionally content with probabilities*
 - *Man is a moment in astronomic time; a transient guest of the earth*

** History and the Earth
 - *Human history is a brief spot in space and its first lesson is modesty*
 - troublesome duplexity
 - *Man's ingenuity often overcomes geological handicaps*
 - Geography is the matrix of history, it's nourishing mother and disciplining home
 - The influence of geographic factors diminishes as technology grows
 - *Man makes civilization*

** Biology and History
 - We belong to this perilous minority on this impartial planet
 - The laws of biology are the fundamental lessons of history
 - History is a fragment of biology
 - The life of man is a portion of the vicissitudes of organisms on land and sea.
 - Inequality is not only natural and inborn, it grows with the complexity of civilization
 - Freedom and equality are sworn and everlasting enemies and when one prevails the other dies
 - Utopias of equality are biologically doomed
 - Leave men free and their natural inequalities will multiply alomost geometrically
 - Nature has no use for organisms, variations or groups that cannot produce abundantly
 - Nature has a passion for quantity as prerequisite to the selection of quality
 - The equilibrium of production and reproduction
 - Ideally parentage should be a privilege of health, not a by-product of sexual agitation
 - Much of what we call intelligence is the result of individual eduction, opportunity and experience
 - Biologically, physical vitality at birth may be of greater value than intellectual pedigree
 - there is no humorist like history
 - The birth rate like war may determine the fate of theologies

** Race and History
 - History is color-blind and can develop a civilization under almost any skin
 - Climatic and geological conditions frustrated them
 - the role of race in history is rather preliminary  than creative
 - Circumstances geographical, economic and political create a culture and the culture creates a human type
 - Civilization is a co-operative product
 - 3 biological lessons of history:
	 - Life is competition
	 - Life is selection
	 - Life must breed
 - It is not the race that makes the civilization, it is the civilization that makes the people
 - In the long run such differences of tradition or type yield to the influence of the environment

** Character and History
 - Society is founded not on the ideals but on the nature of man
 - The constitution of man rewrites the constitution of states
 - Human nature is the fundamental tendencies and nature of mankind
 - most basic tendencies -> instincts
 - Known history shows little alteration in the conduct of mankind
 - *Means and instrumentalities change; ends and motives remain the same*
 - History in the large is the conflict of minorities
 - Evolution in man during recored time has been social rather than biological
 - Social evolution is an interplay of custom with origination
 - Development in the higher organisms require a capacity for experiment and innovation
 - *The imitative majority follows the innovative majority*
 - effects of numberless causes and causes of endless effects
 - Sex is a river of fire that must be banked and cooled by a 100 restraints if it is not
	 to consume in chaos both the individual and the group
 - Intellect is therefore a vital force in history, but it can also be a dissolvent and destructive power
 - The conservative who resists change is as valuable as the radical who proposes it
 - the conservative => resists change
 - the radical => proposes change
 - New ideas should be heard
 - New ideas should be compelled ot go through the mill of objection, opposition and contumely
 - Innovations must survive the trial heat before being allowed to enter the human race
 - creative tensile strenght
 - stimulated development


** Morals and History
 - Morals => the rules by which a society exhorts its members and associations to behaviour consistent with its order,
	 security and growth
 - Laws => the rules by which a society seeks to compel
 - Little knowledge of history => the variability of moral codes
 - Moral codes are negligible because they differ in time and place and sometimes contradict each other
 - Larger knowledge => the universality of moral codes and their necessity
 - economic history:
	 - hunting
	 - agriculture
	 - industry
 - *Insecurity is the mother of greed*
 - Moral codes differ because they adjust themselves to historical and environmental conditions
 - *Probably every vice was once a virtue*
 - *Man's sins may be the relic of his rise rather than the stigmata of his fall*
 - The new regime demanded new virtues and changed some old virtues into vices
 - The city offered every discouragement to marriage, but it provided every stimulus
	 and facility for sex
 - Women were emancipated
 - History offers some consolidation by reminding us that sin has flourished in every age
 - the immortality of our stage differs in kind rather than degree
 - Man has never reconciled himself to the 10 commandments
 - *History as usually written is quite different from history as ususally lived.*
 - *The Historian records the exceptional because it is interesting, because it is exceptional*
 - The freedom of the past varies with the security of the whole
 - History assures us that civilization decay quite leisurely
 - Meanwhile much of our moral freedom is good
 - It is pleasant to be relieved of the theological terrors
	 

** Religion and History
 - Religion has conferred meaning and dignity upon the lowliest existence
 - The natural inequality of men dooms many of us to poverty or defeat
 - *Heaven and utopia are buckets in a well; when one goes down the other goes up*
 - When religion declines, communism grows;
 - Religion does not seem at first to have had any connection with morals
 - *It was fear that first made the gods*
 - Religion became the propitiatory worship of these forces
 - Immortality flourished even in ages of religious domination
 - Morality should stand above power
 - The majestic dream broke under the attacks of nationalism, skepticism and human frailty
 - *Men often proved biased, venal and extortionate*
 - The Church played only a modest part in the outstanding advance of modern morality - the abolition of slavery
 - The growing awareness of man's minuscule place in the cosmos has furthered the impairment of religious belief
 - the ecclesiastical recognition
 - *Nature and history do not agree with our conceptions of good and bad*
 - *Science is the religion of modern emancipated man*
 - The Earth had become a mere suburb in the world
 - The awesome triumphs of scientific technology promising man omnipotence and destruction and challenging the divine
	 command of the skies
 - The idea of hell disappeared from educated thought, even from pulpit homilies
 - Laws which where once presented as the decrees of a god-given thing are now frankly confused commands of fallible men
 - One lesson of history is that religion has many lives and habit of resurrection
 - Puritanism and paganism alternate in mutual reaction in history
 - Puritanism => the repression of the senses and desire
 - Paganism => the expression of the senses and desire
 - *As long as there is poverty, there will be gods*
 - A natural ethic is too weak to withstand the savagery that lurks under civilization and
	 emerges in our dreams

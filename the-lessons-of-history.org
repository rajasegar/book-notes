* The Lessons of History
Author: Will Durant

** Hesitations
 - History has no sense
 - Our knowledge of any past event is always incomplete, probably inaccurate, beclouded by ambivalent
	 evidence and biased historians and perhaps distored by our own patriotic or religious partisanships
 - A multitude of doubts assail our enterprise
 - *Most history is guessing and the rest is prejudice*
 - mutitudinous complexity
 - Historiography cannot be a science
 - *The present is the past rolled up for action and the past is the present unrolled for understanding*
 - Total perspective is an optical illusion
 - All formulas should be suspect
 - *The historian always oversimplifies and hastily selects a manageable minority of facts and faces out
	 of a crowd of souls and events show multitudinous complexity he can never quite embrace or comprehend*
 - We do not know the whole of man's history
 - *We must operate with partial knowledge and be provisionally content with probabilities*
 - *Man is a moment in astronomic time; a transient guest of the earth*

** History and the Earth
 - *Human history is a brief spot in space and its first lesson is modesty*
 - troublesome duplexity
 - *Man's ingenuity often overcomes geological handicaps*
 - Geography is the matrix of history, it's nourishing mother and disciplining home
 - The influence of geographic factors diminishes as technology grows
 - *Man makes civilization*

** Biology and History
 - We belong to this perilous minority on this impartial planet
 - The laws of biology are the fundamental lessons of history
 - History is a fragment of biology
 - The life of man is a portion of the vicissitudes of organisms on land and sea.
 - Inequality is not only natural and inborn, it grows with the complexity of civilization
 - Freedom and equality are sworn and everlasting enemies and when one prevails the other dies
 - Utopias of equality are biologically doomed
 - Leave men free and their natural inequalities will multiply alomost geometrically
 - Nature has no use for organisms, variations or groups that cannot produce abundantly
 - Nature has a passion for quantity as prerequisite to the selection of quality
 - The equilibrium of production and reproduction
 - Ideally parentage should be a privilege of health, not a by-product of sexual agitation
 - Much of what we call intelligence is the result of individual eduction, opportunity and experience
 - Biologically, physical vitality at birth may be of greater value than intellectual pedigree
 - there is no humorist like history
 - The birth rate like war may determine the fate of theologies

** Race and History
 - History is color-blind and can develop a civilization under almost any skin
 - Climatic and geological conditions frustrated them
 - the role of race in history is rather preliminary  than creative
 - Circumstances geographical, economic and political create a culture and the culture creates a human type
 - Civilization is a co-operative product
 - 3 biological lessons of history:
	 - Life is competition
	 - Life is selection
	 - Life must breed
 - It is not the race that makes the civilization, it is the civilization that makes the people
 - In the long run such differences of tradition or type yield to the influence of the environment

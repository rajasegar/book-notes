## Logotherapy in a nutshell
Discovering meaning of life in 3 different ways:
  * by creating a work or doing a deed
  * by experiencing something or encountering someone
  * by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering
  
- Logotherapy is a method less retrospective and less introspective
- Logotherapy focuses on the future, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the future
- Logotherapy is a meaning-centered psychotherapy
- Logotherapy defocuses all the vicious circle formations and feedback mechanisms
- Primary motivational force in man => striving to find a meaning in one's life
- Freudian Psychoanalysis => will to pleasure
- Adrelian psychology => will to power ( striving for superiority)
- Logotherapy => will to meaning
- **What man needs is not homeostasis by noo-dynamics**
- Noo-dynamics => the existential dynamics in a polar field of tension between meaning and man
- **What man actually needs is not a tensionless state, but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.**
- finding a purpose and meaning to life
- Man's search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a secondary rationalization of his instinctual drives.
- Man is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values
- Man's desire for a life that is as meaningful as possible
- There is nothing in the world that would so effective help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one's life.
- unable to see the forest of reality for the trees of symbols and images
- **Some amount of conflict is normal and healthy**
- A man's concern, even his despair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease
- Suffering is not always a pathological phenomenon
- Suffering may well be a human achievement
- Inner tension is an indispensable prerequisite for mental health
- Man is a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning
- Mental health is based on a certain degree of tension
- homeostasis => tensionless state
- ** It is a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium.**
- the beneficial impact of meaning orientation
- Conformism => doing what others do
- Totalianarism => doing what others wish you to do
- Each man is questioned by life and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life.
- One should not search for an abstract meaning of life
- The specific meaning  of a person's life at a given moment
- Everyone's task is as unique as his specific opportunity to implement it
- **Responsibleness is the very essence of human existence**
- The present is past and the pas may yet be changed and amended
- the self-transendence of human existence
- **Self-actualization is possible only as a side effect of self-transendence**
- Man's main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in life
- When we are no longer able to change a situation we are challenged to change ourselves
- Suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning
- In no way is suffering necessary to find meaning
- To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic
- What never can be ruled out is the unavoidability of suffering
- **Life's meaning is an unconditional one, for it even includes the potential meaning of unavoidable suffering**
- Logos is deeper than logic
- What is demanded of man is not to endure the meaninglessness of life, but rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its
  unconditional meaningfulness in rational terms
- Procreation is not the only meaning of life
- Something which in itself is meaningless cannot be rendered meaningful merely by its perpetuation
- The only really transitory aspects of life are the potentialities
- In the past, nothing is irretrievably lost, but everything is irrevocably stored
- Nothing can be undone and nothing can be done away with
- Having been is the surest kind of being
- The pessimist is a man who observes with fear and sadness
- **The wish is the father of thought**
- Logotherapy is activistic not pessimistic
- The fear is the mother of the event

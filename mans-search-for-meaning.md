# Man's search for meaning
Author: Vicktor E Frankl

> He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how. - Nietzsche

- Logotherapy is curing the soul by leading it to find the meaning in life.
- Life is meaningful and that we must learn to see life as meaningful despite our circumstances.
- There is an ultimate purpose to life.
- They died from lack of hope
- Life is primarily not a quest for pleasure, or a quest for power but a quest for meaning.
- Man's inner strength may rise him above his outward fate.
- The man whose self-esteem is always depended on the respect of others will be emotionally destroyed.
- Having a **Why** to live for enabled them to bear with the **How**.
- Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms to choose one's attitude
  in any given set of circumstances and to choose one's own way.
- Life holds a potential meaning under any conditions even the most miserable ones.
- Happiness must happen and the same holds for success.
- Success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.

## Experiences in a concentration camp
- an unrelenting struggle for life itself
- Facts will be significant only as far as they are part of a man's experience.
- Psychology requires a certain scientific detachment.
- Only the man inside knows.
- The war gave us the war of nerves
- Once lost, the will to live seldom returned.
- Like a drowning man clutching a straw
- clung to shreds of hope
- all we possessed literally was our naked existence
- Man is a being who can get used to anything.
- An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is a normal behavior.
- There are things which must cause you to lose your reason or you have none to lose.
- There are moments when indignation can rouse even a seemingly hardened prisoner.
- The salvation of man is through love and in love.
- Love find its deepest meaning in his spiritual being.
- Nothing could touch the strength of love.
- the faces of men who had given up all hope of life and liberty.
- the existence of an ultimate purpose.
- the light shineth in the darkness.
- Humor was another of soul's weapons in the fight for self-preservation
- A very trifling thing can cause the greatest of joys
- Humor can afford an aloofness and ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds.
- **Suffering is omnipresent**.
- The size of human suffering is absolutely relative.
- Suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little.
- the relativity of all suffering appeared obvious.
- **Freedom from suffering is a negative happiness**.
- it is a question of life or death
- grateful for the smallest of mercies
- a last effort to save self-respect
- existence descended to the level of animal life
- complete disregard of human existence
- Fate is one's master, one must not try to influence it any way, but instead let it take its own course.
- At times lightning decisions has to be made.
- Fate has toyed with us.
- Human decisions are just uncertain especially in the matters of life and death.
- treated like complete non-entities
- The consciousness of one's inner value is anchored in higher, more spiritual things.
- Man can preserve a vestige of spritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in terribe conditions of psychic and physical stress.
- Human being is completely and unavoidably influenced by his surroundings.
- the play thing of circumstances
- There are always choices to make
- The last inner freedom cannot be lost
- Fundamentally any man can decide what shall become of him, mentally and spiritually.
- Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death.
- **Without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete**.
- Emotion which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.

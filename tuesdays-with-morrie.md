# Tuesdays with Morrie
Mitch Albom: An old man, young man and life's greatest lessons

## The Audiovisual
- Accept what you are able to do and what you are not able to do.
- Accept the past as past without denying it discarding it.
- Learn to forgive yourself and to forgive others.
- Don't assume that it is too late to get involved.
- Death should not be embarassing


## The Classroom
- The culture we have does not make people to feel good about themselves.
- We are teaching the wrong things.
- And you have to be strong enought to say if culture doesn't work, don't buy it.

## The tension of opposites
- Life is a series of pulls back and forth.
- You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else.
- Something hurts you, yet you know it shouldn't.
- You take certain things for granted, even when you know you should never take anything for granted.
- A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band. And most of us live somewhere in the middle.
- Love wins, love always wins.


## Taking Attendance
- We are chasing the wrong things.
- The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to others.
- So many people walk around us with a meaningless life
- Devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.
- Money is not the most important thing
- need to be fully human
- The alienation of youth and the need for connectedness with the society.

## First Tuesday: We talk about the world
- Look at life uniquely.
- Death is the great equalizer, the one big thing that can finally make strangers shed a tear for one another.
- Love is the only rational act
- The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let it come in.

## The Fourth Tuesday: We talk about Death
- Everyone knows they are going to die, but nobody believes it. If we did, we would do things differently
- The truth is once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.

- **We really don't experience the world fully.**
- The bird on your shoulder
- Memento Mori - Remember death
- If you accept that you can die at any time, then you might not be as ambitious as you are.

## The Seventh Tuesday: We talk about the fear of aging
- unconditional love
- unconditional attention
- Young are not wise, they have little understanding about life.
- Aging is not just decay, it's growth.
- Aging is more than the negative that you're going to die.
- Agins is also the positive that you understand that you are going to die, and that you live a better life because of it.

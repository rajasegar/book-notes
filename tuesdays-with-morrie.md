# Tuesdays with Morrie
Mitch Albom: An old man, young man and life's greatest lessons

## The Audiovisual
- Accept what you are able to do and what you are not able to do.
- Accept the past as past without denying it discarding it.
- Learn to forgive yourself and to forgive others.
- Don't assume that it is too late to get involved.
- Death should not be embarassing


## The Classroom
- The culture we have does not make people to feel good about themselves.
- We are teaching the wrong things.
- And you have to be strong enought to say if culture doesn't work, don't buy it.

## The tension of opposites
- Life is a series of pulls back and forth.
- You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else.
- Something hurts you, yet you know it shouldn't.
- You take certain things for granted, even when you know you should never take anything for granted.
- A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band. And most of us live somewhere in the middle.
- Love wins, love always wins.


## Taking Attendance
- We are chasing the wrong things.
- The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to others.
- So many people walk around us with a meaningless life
- Devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.
- Money is not the most important thing
- need to be fully human
- The alienation of youth and the need for connectedness with the society.

## First Tuesday: We talk about the world
- Look at life uniquely.
- Death is the great equalizer, the one big thing that can finally make strangers shed a tear for one another.
- Love is the only rational act
- The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let it come in.
- the effect of silence on human relations
- Why are we embarrassed with silence?
- What comfort do we find in all the noise?

## Second Tuesday: We Talk about feeling sorry for yourself
- Put a daily limit on self pity.
- Concentrate on all the good things in life
- the seeds of death
- the coldest realization
- **Sometimes you cannot believe what you see, and you have to believe what you feel.**

## Third Tuesday: We talk about regrets
- desperate attempt
- mystical clarity of thought
- We are so wrapped up with egotistical things
- We all need teachers in our lives.
- We dont't get into the habit of standing back and looking at our lives.
- Seek success or seek simplicity.
- Every confused and tortured soul wanted clarity.
- the idea is momentarity appealing.

## The Audiovisual Part 2
- How do you know things are going downhill?

## The Professor
- would accept nothing less than excellence
> A teacher affects eternity, he can never tell where his influence stops. - Henry Adams

## The Fourth Tuesday: We talk about Death
- Everyone knows they are going to die, but nobody believes it. If we did, we would do things differently

* Deep Simplicity
Author: John Gribbin

- The simplicity of nature is not be measured by that of our conceptions
- Nature is simple only in its causes
- The laws will turn out to be simple

** Introduction: The Simplicity of Complexity
   - Simple truths are eternal
   - Our lives are the mercy of complicated processes that produce dramatic changes out of the blue
   - Most interesting question of all => how life could have emerged from non-life
   - The most interesting question of all remain unanswered.
   - Science made enormous progress largely by ignoring the complexities and focusing on the simple questions
   - Gravity crushes any structure out of existence
   - *It is the simplicity that underpins complexity*
   - *Chaos and complexity obey simple laws*
   - *The complicated behavior of the world we see around us is merely surface complexity arising out of deep simplicity*
   - All business of chaos and complexity is based on two simple ideas:
     - the sensitivity of a system to its starting conditions
     - feedback
   - There are simple truths underpinning chaos and complexity

** Order out of chaos
   - There are simple, orderly laws underpinning the confusion of the world
   - There are simple situations which have unpredictable outcomes
   - Entropy measures the amount of order in a system
   - You can never put things back the way they used to be
   - Life is creating order and structure out of disordered materials
   - In the real world, there is no such thing as a perfect insulator
   - The truth is there is no such thing as an isolated system (except for the entire Universe)
   - No system is ever in perfect equilibrium.
   - It may get very close to equilibrium - as close as you like, if you wait long enough - but the equilibrium is never literally perfect.
   - We live in an orderly world
   - Sirius - one of the nearest stars
   - Thermodynamics and the idea of increasing entropy are statistical ideas
   - The world is not deterministic in the simplest sense after all, and that chance and probability must be taken into account when trying
     to describe or calculate the behavior of macroscopic systems
   - chaotic and unpredictable fashion

** The Return of Chaos
   - Many systems in the real world are sensitive to their initial conditions and that they move away from those starting conditions in a non-linear fashtion.
   - There is no way at all to predict or know the future except by watching the Universe evolve
   - In our everyday lives, most changes occur in a linear fashion
   - You should take nothing for granted.
   - The only system that can replicate the behaviour of the Universe in every detail, is the Universe itself.
   - Instability is the normal
   - Permanently stable orbits are the exception
   - The Universe is ignorant of its own future and is its own fastest simulator
   - A non-linear system may be either much more or much less than the sum of its parts.
   - A linear system is more or less equal to the sum of its parts
   - Non-linear things move very swiftly away from their starting points
   - In some circumstances we cannot calculate just how a system will change as time passes because the information we have
     about it's starting conditions is not accurate enough
   - Small differences in the initial conditions produce very great ones in the final phenomena
   - *Deterministic universe could never be predicted in practice, either forwards or backwards*
   - The observations were neither sufficiently comprehensive nor sufficiently precise
   - Linear forecasting techniques were far from perfect.
   - Linear equations are easier to work with than non-linear equations.
   - toy models = simplifications
   - Butterfly effect => the sensitivity of the weather (and other complex systems) to initial conditions
   - The errors and uncertainties inherent in the observations matter significantly
   - The underlying simplicity from which chaos and complexity emerge:
     - simple laws
     - non-linearity
     - sensitivity to initial conditions
     - feedback
   - *Simple laws, non-linearity, sensitivity to initial conditions and feedback are what make the world tick*
   - Resonance - way of getting a large return for a relatively small effort, by making the effort at just the right time and pushing a system the way it wants to go
   - *We owe our existence directly to the effects of chaos at work in the asteroid belt*
   - The orbits of the planets are technically chaotic
   - obliquity - angle of tilt of a planet
   - pi - irrational number
   - *Time cannot, in principle, be reversed*
   - *The Universe cannot, in principle, be predicted in all its details*
   - *Chaos is inevitable*
   - No computer can be bigger than the entire universe
   - *The complexity of the universe is based on the deep simplicity*
   - *The complexity of the universe has emerged from the chaos*
   - *Life itself has emerged from the chaos*

** Chaos out of order
 - *Understanding the emergence of life is the utimate aim*
 - an unbroken chain of cause and effect
 - The road to chaos involves an infinite no of choices operating on an infinitely small scale
 - logistic equation = describes how the population of a species changes from one generation to the next
 - *In the midst of order there is chaos; in the midst of chaos there is order*
 - It is overwhelmingly more likely that a system will fall in to the chaotic regime
 - A completely random iterative process obeying a very simple rule has built up a fractal pattern
 - *It is randomness plus a simple iterative rule (or rules) that makes the complexity of the world*
 - complex numbers => 2D, everyday numbers => 1D
 - *Complexity arises from simplicity*
 - *The way to make complex structures out of simple rules is repetition*
 - *The underlying simplicity of the world can produce complex structures*
 - Near fractal self-similarity is a pervasive feature of the bodies of living organisms
 - *Complexity lives at the edge of chaos*
 - The most complex and interesting things in the universe are happening right at the end of chaos, just before order is destroyed.

** The Edge of Chaos

 - *The nearest a living thing ever gets to equilibrium is when it dies*
 - The gravitational force between two objects diminishes as they get further apart
 - Energy flowing through an open system and being dissipated
 - The gravitational energy of any object that has mass is negative
 - More compact object -> more negative its gravitational energy
 - The amount of gravitational energy stored in a collection of objects depends on the force between them.
 - *Universe could have appeared out of nothing at all*
 - A star might be created out of nothing at all
 - The Universe started out from the big bang in a very uniform state
 - Light takes a finite time to travel through space
 - Time elapsed since the Big Bang - 14 billion years
 - *The Universe is not in thermodynamic equilibrium*

** Earthquakes, extinctions and emergence
 - We are the natural expression of the deeper order

** The Facts of Life
 - Evolution is a fact of life
 - *The stable scenario is not necessarily the best scenario*
 - widening ripple of interactions
 - Evolution by natural selection will ensure that a change which is detrimental to the species involved will be washed away over the generations
 - A change that is beneficial  will spread and by spreading it will open up more networks pushing the system towards the edge of chaos
 - *Complex systems naturally evolve towards the phase transition at the edge of chaos*
 - In the static regime, nothing changes
 - In the chaotic regime, the changes are so rapid that nothing interesting can ever get time to happen
 - All species must evolve as fast as they can just to keep up with other species
 - The cut and try of evolution is not just to build a good animal, but to find good building blocks that can be put together to make many good animals
 - Species get neither better at surviving nor worse as time passes; they die off at random
 - *The struggle for survival is just as hard as it used to be*
 - *Successful species actually get better at evolving as time passes*
 - Evolution operates at the level of the individual
 - Change happens only slowly from one generation to the next
 - Sparsely connected networks naturally evolve to such a state with intervals of equilibrium punctuated by intervals of change
 - Earthquakes always begin at the point where the strain that has built up first exceeds some critical threshold
 - Simple models do give a good description of the real world
 - *The test of a good model is not how simple it is, but how well it provides insight into real systems*
 - the underlying simplicity of the worlk
 - All of the different effects produce the same pattern.
 - When the physical environment changes, the fitness landscape changes
 - The physical environment and the biological environment are interconnected much more subtly than it seems at first sight

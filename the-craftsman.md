# The Craftsman
Author: Richard Sennett

## Prologue: Man as his own maker Pandora's Casket

## Craftsman

- Craftsmanship is certainly from an ethical point o view ambiguous

We human beings live in 2 dimensions:
- In one we make things, in this condition we are amoral and absorbed in a task
- We also harbor another higher way of life in which we stop producing and start
  discussing and judging

- People can learn about themselves through the things they make
- We can do so simply by asking - though the answers are anything but simple
- What the process of making concrete things reveals to us about ourselves
- *Fundamental human limit* Language is not an adequate "mirror tool" for the physical movements of the human body
- Failure can teach a fundamental modesty even if that virtue is gained at great pain
- Only the rich can afford to be stupid; for others ability is a necessity not an option
- Art plays a particular role in this life voyage atleast for artists.
- The work of art become like a buoy at sea marking out the journey
- There is an intelligent craftsman in most of us
- Faith still makes sense
- **The Good Craftsman is a poor salesman**
- Craftsmanship names an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake

* Thinking in Numbers
How Maths Illuminates our lives
Author: Daniel Tammet

** Family Values
 - Numerical patterns were the matter of our world
 - Numbers belong to life
 - Like colors, the commonest numbers give character, form and dimension to our world.
 - an infinitely complex world
 - Definining a set owes more to art than it does to science
 - equally legitimate possibilities
 - Memory is a further example of the priveleging of certain subsets (of experience) over others,
   in how we think and talk about a category of things.
 - Mathematical ideas help expand our circle of empathy, liberating us from the tyranny
   of a single, parochial point of view.
 - *Numbers properly considered make us better people*

** Eternity in an Hour
 - the mystery of infinity
 - vast panoply of information
 - The familiar now became the strange, the strange become familiar
 - the infinitely many points that can divide the space between two human hearts
 - 

** Counting to Four in Icelandic
 - In a conversation, the language is always fluid, moving and you have to move with it.
 - the warm blood of annoyance
 - highly refined discrimination
 - Humans can count in flashes only upto to quantities of four.
 - *The smallest numbers loom largest in our minds*
 - sound straightforward and conventional
 - cacophonic ejections into comprehensive words and phrases
 - counting requires some prior understanding of what 'one' is
 - 
   

** Proverbs and Time Tables
 - the little shiver of excitement
 - *There are only so many proverbs a healthy man can take*
 - a point of surfeit is reached
 - Taken in excess, proverbs lose all the familiar felicities of their compact structure
 - *100 Proverbs, give or take, sum up the essence of a culture*
 - reduce the risk of anxiety
 - *A numerate culture will find whatever means at its disposal to pass these obstinate facts down from one generation to the next*
 - simple and succinct
 - *Blind is the bookless man*
 - pondered in marvellous depth
 - inquisitive detail
 - The trimming of unnecessary words or sounds shapes both the proverb and the times table
 - more radical contributors
 - the greatest ease and pleasure
 - *Nobody is above mistakes*
 - *It is the memory that is to blame*
 - *Hold fast to the words of ancestors*

- the countless conceivable possibilities
- Reality is a very subjective affair...You can get nearer and nearer, 
  so to speak, to reality; but you never get near enough because reality
  is an infinite succession of steps, levels of perception, false bottoms, and 
  hence unquenchable, unattainable.
- You can know more and more about one thing but you can never know everything about one thing: it's hopeless
- **To learn infinitely many things, we would only ever need perfect knowledge of one book**
- Every reading differs; every reading  offers something new
- It's impossible to dip into the same book twice.

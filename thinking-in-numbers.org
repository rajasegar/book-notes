* Thinking in Numbers
How Maths Illuminates our lives
Author: Daniel Tammet

** Family Values
 - Numerical patterns were the matter of our world
 - Numbers belong to life
 - Like colors, the commonest numbers give character, form and dimension to our world.
 - an infinitely complex world
 - Definining a set owes more to art than it does to science
 - equally legitimate possibilities
 - Memory is a further example of the priveleging of certain subsets (of experience) over others,
   in how we think and talk about a category of things.
 - Mathematical ideas help expand our circle of empathy, liberating us from the tyranny
   of a single, parochial point of view.
 - *Numbers properly considered make us better people*

** Eternity in an Hour
 - the mystery of infinity
 - vast panoply of information
 - The familiar now became the strange, the strange become familiar
 - the infinitely many points that can divide the space between two human hearts
 - 

** Counting to Four in Icelandic
 - In a conversation, the language is always fluid, moving and you have to move with it.
 - the warm blood of annoyance
 - highly refined discrimination
 - Humans can count in flashes only upto to quantities of four.
 - *The smallest numbers loom largest in our minds*
 - sound straightforward and conventional
 - cacophonic ejections into comprehensive words and phrases
 - counting requires some prior understanding of what 'one' is
 - 
   

** Proverbs and Time Tables
 - the little shiver of excitement
 - *There are only so many proverbs a healthy man can take*
 - a point of surfeit is reached
 - Taken in excess, proverbs lose all the familiar felicities of their compact structure
 - *100 Proverbs, give or take, sum up the essence of a culture*
 - reduce the risk of anxiety
 - *A numerate culture will find whatever means at its disposal to pass these obstinate facts down from one generation to the next*
 - simple and succinct
 - *Blind is the bookless man*
 - pondered in marvellous depth
 - inquisitive detail
 - The trimming of unnecessary words or sounds shapes both the proverb and the times table
 - more radical contributors
 - the greatest ease and pleasure
 - *Nobody is above mistakes*
 - *It is the memory that is to blame*
 - *Hold fast to the words of ancestors*

** Classroom Intuitions
 - reduced to the recollection
 - *The study of Mathematics has no end*
 - *The things we each do not know about Mathematics are infinite*
 - the rudiments of algebra
 - left a deep impression
 - failure to comprehend
 - generally polite and industrious
 - small but clever insight
 - not ignorance, but rather indecision
 - To say tha a student has no idea of a solution is untrue
 - Truth is, the learner does have ideas, too many infact , almost all of them bad.
 - *Mental haze* \rarr having too many ideas
 - Without the knowledge necessary to eliminate the mental haze, the learner finds
   himself confronted with an embarassment of wrong answers to helplessly pick from.
 - The growing body of knowledge is the process of error correction
 - Real value \rightarrow have the bullion of hard experience to back them up
 - beautiful conclusion
 - There is no thing that half of it is nothing.
   

** Shakespeare's Zero
 - the ultimate negation
 - the idea of nothingness
 - the new and the paradoxical no
 - Zero 'signifies nothing' but instead 'holds a place and signifies for others'
 - The bigger an empty room, the more the things that can be contained inside.
 - *The greater an absence, the greater the potential presence*
 - the paradoxical fullness of the empty figure of a zero
   

** Shapes of Speech
 - the atmosphere of intrigue and anticipation
 - communes with nature
 - the prizing of pattern over matter
 - appetite for novelty
 - the study of geometry into a liberal education
 - an immaterial and intellectual manner
 - timing was impeccable
 - one carefully laid path of reasoning
 - *The flash of certainty is an illusion*
 - *The grasping of an absolute truth is an illusion*
 - Rhetoric \rarr the art of speaking
 - A mathematical proof is a rhetorical device for convincing someone else that a mathematical statement is true or valid.
 - building blocks of our systems of thought
 - Maths in real life is a form of social interaction where "proof" is a complex of the formal and the informal of calculations
   causal comments, of convincing argument and appeals to the imagination and the intuition
 - Establishing motive is an exercise in basic mathematical logic
 - the history of intellectual progress
 - *Axioms* \rArr statements that we accept as being self-evidently true
 - definitions:
   - concise
   - basic
   - unambiguous
 - 2 ways of establishing a proposition:
   - by trying to demonstrate it upon reason
   - to pass it by the weight of pure authority
 - Proposition \to Clarification \to Axiom \to Conclusion

- the countless conceivable possibilities
- Reality is a very subjective affair...You can get nearer and nearer, 
  so to speak, to reality; but you never get near enough because reality
  is an infinite succession of steps, levels of perception, false bottoms, and 
  hence unquenchable, unattainable.
- You can know more and more about one thing but you can never know everything about one thing: it's hopeless
- **To learn infinitely many things, we would only ever need perfect knowledge of one book**
- Every reading differs; every reading  offers something new
- It's impossible to dip into the same book twice.

* Thinking in Numbers
How Maths Illuminates our lives
Author: Daniel Tammet

** Family Values
 - Numerical patterns were the matter of our world
 - Numbers belong to life
 - Like colors, the commonest numbers give character, form and dimension to our world.
 - an infinitely complex world
 - Definining a set owes more to art than it does to science
 - equally legitimate possibilities
 - Memory is a further example of the priveleging of certain subsets (of experience) over others,
   in how we think and talk about a category of things.
 - Mathematical ideas help expand our circle of empathy, liberating us from the tyranny
   of a single, parochial point of view.
 - *Numbers properly considered make us better people*

** Eternity in an Hour
 - the mystery of infinity
 - vast panoply of information
 - The familiar now became the strange, the strange become familiar
 - the infinitely many points that can divide the space between two human hearts
 - 

** Counting to Four in Icelandic
 - In a conversation, the language is always fluid, moving and you have to move with it.
 - the warm blood of annoyance
 - highly refined discrimination
 - Humans can count in flashes only upto to quantities of four.
 - *The smallest numbers loom largest in our minds*
 - sound straightforward and conventional
 - cacophonic ejections into comprehensive words and phrases
 - counting requires some prior understanding of what 'one' is
 - 
   

** Proverbs and Time Tables
 - the little shiver of excitement
 - *There are only so many proverbs a healthy man can take*
 - a point of surfeit is reached
 - Taken in excess, proverbs lose all the familiar felicities of their compact structure
 - *100 Proverbs, give or take, sum up the essence of a culture*
 - reduce the risk of anxiety
 - *A numerate culture will find whatever means at its disposal to pass these obstinate facts down from one generation to the next*
 - simple and succinct
 - *Blind is the bookless man*
 - pondered in marvellous depth
 - inquisitive detail
 - The trimming of unnecessary words or sounds shapes both the proverb and the times table
 - more radical contributors
 - the greatest ease and pleasure
 - *Nobody is above mistakes*
 - *It is the memory that is to blame*
 - *Hold fast to the words of ancestors*

** Classroom Intuitions
 - reduced to the recollection
 - *The study of Mathematics has no end*
 - *The things we each do not know about Mathematics are infinite*
 - the rudiments of algebra
 - left a deep impression
 - failure to comprehend
 - generally polite and industrious
 - small but clever insight
 - not ignorance, but rather indecision
 - To say tha a student has no idea of a solution is untrue
 - Truth is, the learner does have ideas, too many infact , almost all of them bad.
 - *Mental haze* \rarr having too many ideas
 - Without the knowledge necessary to eliminate the mental haze, the learner finds
   himself confronted with an embarassment of wrong answers to helplessly pick from.
 - The growing body of knowledge is the process of error correction
 - Real value \rightarrow have the bullion of hard experience to back them up
 - beautiful conclusion
 - There is no thing that half of it is nothing.
   

** Shakespeare's Zero
 - the ultimate negation
 - the idea of nothingness
 - the new and the paradoxical no
 - Zero 'signifies nothing' but instead 'holds a place and signifies for others'
 - The bigger an empty room, the more the things that can be contained inside.
 - *The greater an absence, the greater the potential presence*
 - the paradoxical fullness of the empty figure of a zero
   

** Shapes of Speech
 - the atmosphere of intrigue and anticipation
 - communes with nature
 - the prizing of pattern over matter
 - appetite for novelty
 - the study of geometry into a liberal education
 - an immaterial and intellectual manner
 - timing was impeccable
 - one carefully laid path of reasoning
 - *The flash of certainty is an illusion*
 - *The grasping of an absolute truth is an illusion*
 - Rhetoric \rarr the art of speaking
 - A mathematical proof is a rhetorical device for convincing someone else that a mathematical statement is true or valid.
 - building blocks of our systems of thought
 - Maths in real life is a form of social interaction where "proof" is a complex of the formal and the informal of calculations
   causal comments, of convincing argument and appeals to the imagination and the intuition
 - Establishing motive is an exercise in basic mathematical logic
 - the history of intellectual progress
 - *Axioms* \rArr statements that we accept as being self-evidently true
 - definitions:
   - concise
   - basic
   - unambiguous
 - 2 ways of establishing a proposition:
   - by trying to demonstrate it upon reason
   - to pass it by the weight of pure authority
 - Proposition \to Clarification \to Axiom \to Conclusion

 - Perhaps this is why we will never tire of it's wonder

** Invisible Cities
 - wide and expansive
 - expansive in every sense of the word
 - Cities are the embodiments of numerical patterns that contain and direct our lives
 - Not all cities find their territory; many remian forever orphans.
 - Without a city, man would dwell in a fearful, illimitable desert.
 - Too large a city would be no help either.
 - *Praise of moderation:* the half is greather than the whole.
 - *5040* - highly composite number - it can be divided in multiple ways.
 - a scale of maginificence
 - a majestic world of art

** Are We Alone?
 - *Space lies empty and infinite in all directions*
 - Atoms in countless numbers fly every which way through it's furthest reaches
 - It is utterly unrealistic to think that ours are the only world.
 - a cosmos of many worlds

 - We are not the sole thinkers in this great universe
 - *probability is a sesame word*
 - *Sesame word* => open ears and minds
 - The formation of intelligent life was a once-in-a-universe event
 - all encompassing solitude
 - smacked of uniqueness
 - Life will get going just as soon as it is given the chance
 - the question of intelligence
 - questioning minds were anything but universal
 - *Civilization after all is a tricky business; hazardous too
 - a trajectory inevitable
 - almost absolute certainty
 - With time, the technology became refined and upgraded
 - *You would have to be superhuman not to doubt*
 - a cosmic blink of an eye
 - Strictly deterministic thinking is often quite legitimate for physical phenomena,
   but it is quite inappropriate for evolutionary events or social processes such as the
   origin of civilizations.
 - imminent detection
 - *Knowing we are the only ones might make us realize that we are too valuable to destroy*
 - Probability is often expressed using large but finite numbers.
 - Perhaps the probability of life, intelligent life, appearing somewhere in our universe is infinitesimal.

** The Calendar of Omar Khayyam
 - *Time is an all-enveloping and all-enfeebling mist, without clear shape or pattern*
 - the idea of life as constituted by a flux of vague, continuous and causal moments
 - conscious creation
 - apocalyptic prediction
 - receptivity to inspiration
 -

** Counting by Elevens
 - *Thumbs are the master fingers of the hand.*
 - free of conscious effort or instruction

 - *Nothing is contrary to nature*
 - Let the universal and natural reason expel the error and astonishment that novelty bring along with it.

 - requires all my force and all my faith to extract it
   
   

** Einstein's Equations
 - The highest praise for a good theory or a good piece of work was not that it was correct
   nor that it was exact but that it was beautiful
 - The barrier to an appreciation of mathematical beauty is not insurmountable, however
 - predilection for beauty
 - the interest and admiration of many mathematicians
 - the primacy of the aesthetic
 - Numbers are beautiful. If they are not beautiful nothing is combining great elegance with economy.
 - We are impressed yet unmoved by them.
 - More usually what we laymen really admire in the work of Euclid or an Einstein is it's ingenuity
   rather than it's beauty.
 - grasping of music => fleeting and transient
 - the relationship between musical and mathematical beauty

* Writing Solid code
- the growing complexity of software
- The key to writing bug-free code is to become more aware of how bugs come about
  *How could I have prevented this bug?*
  *How could I automatically detected this bug?*
  cultivate awareness
  Bugs caused by:
   - bad function arguments
     accidental use of undefined behaviour
     mistaken assumptions by other programmers
     impossible conditions that nevertheless somehow show up
  Ridding your code of bugs
  Integrity checks can also be used to eliminate rare behavior
  use unambiguous data types
  avoid parasitic functions
  Without the proper attitude and a set of good programming habits, writing bug-free code will be much harder than it needs to be.

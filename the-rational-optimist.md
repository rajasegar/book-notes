# The Rational optimist
Author: Matt Ridley

- Embrace change, be rationally optimistic
- There is a great deal of human life that doesnâ€™t change
- For culture to turn cumulative, ideas need to meet and mate.
- To create is to recombine
- Exchange is to cultural evolution as sex is to biological evolution
- A Rational optimist is one who has arrived at optimism not through temperament or instinct, but by looking at the evidence
- The way that markets in goods, services and ideas allow human beings to exchange and specialize honestly for the betterment of all

## A better today
- The environment is surely deteriorating.
- The true measure of something's worth is the hours it take to acquire it.
- Prosperity is the increase in the amout of goods or services you can earn with the same amount of work.
- **The true measure of prosperity is time.** 
- The big gains in happiness comes from living in a society that frees you to make choices about your lifestyle.
- People are programmed to desire, not to appreciate.
- Getting richer is not the only or even the best way of getting happier.
- The more individualized the nation, the more citizens enjoy their life.
- **Assuming the worst will not avert the fates. Striving to continue improving the human lot may.**
- The continuing imperfection of the world places a moral duty on the humanity to allow economic evolution to continue.
- In a sorry world, there is no safety to be found in standing still.
- Growth will resume unless prevented by the wrong policies.
- As long as new ideas can breed, then human economic progress can continue.
- The betterment of human lives will eventually resume.
- **Self-sufficiency is not the road to prosperity.**
- To produce implies that the producer desire to consume.
- **The magic of specialization and exchange**
- Exchange and specialization have wrought magic for the human species.
- Self-sufficiency is poverty.


## The collective brain: exchange and specialization after 200,000 years ago
- Natural selection is a conservative force.
- Language is the key to cultural evolution.
- Catallaxy: the ever expanding possibility generated by a growing division of labor.
- Trade is often unequal but benefits both sides.
- Exchange is a thing of explosive possibility.
- Control of fire had a far-reaching effect on human evolution.
- Human beings are the only great apes  with long pair of bonds.
- We had stuck our camp forever and were  out upon the roads.
- Barter was the trick that changed the world.
- It's rare for a predator to wipe out its prey altogether.
- Human beings could innovate their way out of trouble.
- Human beings have a deep capacity for isolationism, for fragmenting into groups that diverge from each other.
- Specialization -> Expertise -> Improvement
- Specialization would also give the specialist an excuse for investing time for develping a laborious new technique.
- Specialization would therefore create and increase the opportunities for gains from trade.
- **We innovate by making mistakes that are very occasionally improvements.**
- Human beings learn skills from each other by copying prestigious individuals.
- It was the trade networks that made the difference.
- Technology was made possible by division of labor.
- Market exchange calls forth innovation.
- Culture works by faithful imitation with a bias towards imitating prestigious individuals.
- People concentrated on learning skills that they could watch first-hand.
- Acquiring a skill costs a lot of time and effort.
- Self-sufficiency was dead tens of thousands of years ago.
- The success of human beings depends crucially, but precariously on numbers and connections.
- A few hundred people cannot sustain a sophisticated technology: trade is vital part of the story.
- Human cultural progress is a collective enterprise and it needs a dense collective brain.
- A large interconnected population meant faster cumulative invention.


> Population growth leading to diminishing returns is fiction; the induced increase in productivity is a scientific fact. - Juliam Simon

## The manufacture of virtue: barter, trust and rules after 50,000 years ago
- There is no human tribe that does not trade.
- **Trade is prehistoric and ubiquitous**
- Benevolence and friendship are necessary but not sufficient for society to function.
- Oxytocin is a physiologic signature of empathy and appears to induce a temporary attachment to others.
- Human beings are capable of empathy and are discerning trustees.
- Trust growth seems to precede income growth.
- Exchange breeds trust as much as vice versa.
- With frequent setbacks, trust has gradually and progressively grown, spread and deepened during human history because of exchange.
- The hisory of human propsperity lies in the repeated discovery of non-zero sum bargains that benefit both sides.
- Zero-sum thinking dominates the population discourse.
- Commerce is rather favorable to liberty.
- Wherever the ways of men are gentle there is commerce and wherever there is commerce the ways of men are gentle.
- Prudence might be a less bloody virtue than courage or honor or faith.
- Coercion is the opposite of freedom
- Commercial behaviour may make people more moral.
- We happen to be becoming nicer as we become  more irretrievably dependent on markers and free enterprise.
- Poverty is not a barrier to charity, but welfare is.
- When the market economy booms so does philanthrophy.
- People were enriching themselves and demanding higher standards.
- Niches are thriving.
- Liberty and welfare march hand in hand with prosperity and trade.
- The collective brain enriches the culture and stimulates spirit.
- Smaller scale => better planning
- Where commerce thrive, creativity and compassion both flourish.
- Good rules reward exchange and specialization.
- Bad rules reward confiscation and politicking.
- A country's economic freedom predicts its prosperity, better than its mineral wealth, education system or infrastructure do.
- Institutions and rules are evolutionary phenomena.
- Human history is driven by a co-evolution of rules and tools.
- The increasing specialization of the human species, and the enlarging habit of exchange, are the root cause of innovation in both.
- Institutional innovators are vital in the public sphere.
- Technological innovation are vital in the private sphere.
- Specialization is key to both.


## The feeding of the nine billion: farming after 10,000 years ago
- Farming is the extension of specialization and exchange to include other species.
- Agriculture diverts the labour of other species to providing services for human beings
- Capital is a certain quntity of labour, stocked an stored up to be employed, if necessary, upon some other occasion.
- It was agriculture that made capital possible by generating stored surpluses.
- Trade provided the incentive to specialize in formed goods and to generate surplus food.
- Agriculture was possible because of trade.
- It was agriculture that made capital possible by generating stored surpluses.
- Farming does not work in a highly volatile climate.
- Farming was just another expression of trade.
- Trade came first.
- The first farmers were already enthusiastic traders breaking free of subsistence through exchange.
- Trade comes first, not last.
- Farming works precisely because it is embedded in trading networks.
- The more wealthy somebody is the more things he acquires from specialists.
- People respond to incentives and always have done.
- People weigh costs and benefits and do what profits them.
- **The characteristic signature of poverty is a return to self-sufficiency.**
- **The characteristic signature of prosperity is increasing specialization.**
- Modern economists often exaggerate the cold-hearted rationality of consumers.
- Agriculture may have worsened sexual inequality
- Intensive farming saves nature.
- Intensification has saved 44% of this planet for wilderness.
- Intensification is the best thing that ever happened from the environmental perspective.
- HANPP - Human appropriation of Net Primary Products
- Intensifying agriculture could feed more people and still support more other species too.
- If we all turned vegetarian, the amount of land we would need would be still less, but if we turned organic, it would be more.
- The wastefulness of irrigation is a product of the low price of water.
- Global trade distributes the result to ensure that everybody gets a bit of everything.
- Substitutes will be adopted if the price rises high enough.
- The theme of specialized production / diversified consumption turns out to be the key to prosperity.
- Organic farming is low yield.
- The immense expansion of wilderness throughout the world is a wonderful goal.
- This goal can only be brought about by further intensification and change, not by retreat and organic subsistence.
- In the pursuit of quantity science may be sacrificed the nutritional quality of food.

## The triump of cities: trade after 5,000 years ago
- Monopoly rewards caution and discourages experiment.
- You cannot keep a good idea down.
- Trade is like a machine that turns potatoes into computers, or anything into anything; who would not want such a machine at their disposal?
- Cities exist for trade. They are places where people come to divide their labour, to specialize and exchange.
- Big cities have always depended on rural immigrants to sustain their numbers.
- Production was becoming more specialzed, consumption more diversified.
- Merchants make wealth, chiefs nationalize it.
- Market came long before the other appurtenances of civilization.
- Each empire was the product of trading wealth and was itself the eventual cause of that wealth's destruction.
- There was not just mutual dependence, but mutual gain.
- Intensification of trade came first.
- The urban revolution was an extension of the division of labour.
- Trade emerged from the interactions of the individuals. It evolved. Nobody was in charge.
- The income is gradually captured in the interests of the producers at the expense of the interest of the consumers.
- Commerce was the cause not the symptom of prosperity.
- Trade was the flywheel of the innovation machine.
- The snobbery of the elite towards trade has ancient roots.
- Mutual dependence and gains from trade would have emerged from unexpected places.
- Political fragmentation is often the friend, not the enemy of economic advance.
- Trade made possible the cross-fertilization of ideas that led to great discoveries.
- Plainly, there is something beneficial to the growth of the division of labour, when governments are limited, republican or fragmented.
- **Monopolies always grow complacent, stagnant and self-serving**.
- Strong governments are by definition monopolies.
- Entrepreneurs are rational and if they find that wealth can more easily be stolen than created, then they will steal.
- Humanity's great battle over the last 10,000 years has been the battle against monopoly.
- Inexorably, gains from trade could be rediscovered.
- People could become consumers again, which meant that they could also become producers.
- Empires, indeed governments, generally, tend to be good things at first and bad things the longer they last.
- A greater threat comes from government failure.
- Because it is a monopoly, government brings inefficiency and stagnation to most things it runs.
- High social status + low salaries = corruption and rent-seeking
- They kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.
- Competition was a grand incentive to European industrialisation and brake on bureaucratic suffocation, at the national as well as the corporate level.
- **Free trade causes mutual prosperity while protectionism causes poverty**.
- Free trade works for countries even if they do it and their neighbours do not.
- **Every country that tride protectionism suffered.**
- Protectionist measures exacerbated the economic collapse.
- Rural self-sufficiency is a romantic mirage.
- It is a measure of economic progress that more than half of the population can leave subsistence and seek the possibilities of a life based on the collective brain instead.
- Subsistence farming is a poverty trap and an environmental disaster.
- It is less of a race to the bottom and more of a race to raise the bottom.
- The best thing we can do for the planet is to build more skyscrapers.

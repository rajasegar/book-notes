Author: Oliver Burkeman

- Life is a succession of transient experiences, valuable in themselves, which you will miss if you are completely focusing on the
	destination to which you hope they might be leading.
- Hard choices are unavoidable
- Tough choices are inevitable
- Seek out novelty in the mundane
- Denying reality never works
- Pay yourself first
- Limit your work in progress
- Resist the allure of middling priorities

** Introduction: The Ruler, The Clock and the Thermometer
- *New ideas expand our horizons*
- Metrology - study of measurement
- Temperature was necessarily part of the narrative, not a peripheral marker

** 98.6
- Hypothermia < Normal Temperature < Pyrexia
- We can only marvel at the efficient workings of a system that has evolved over millions of years
- Having a constant body temperature is simply the best evolutionary choice for animals as complex as we are
- Constant temperature is best for us
- We function most efficiently in the vicinity of 100 degrees Fahrenheit
- A higher body internal thermostat settings affords greater activity
- Most machines are quite inefficient
- > 70% of energy input into the body is converted into heat
- Heat always flow from hotter to colder objects
- 98.6 degrees => the point where heat in equals heat out
- Form follow function and decoration follows form

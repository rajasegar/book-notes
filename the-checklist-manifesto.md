# The Checklist Manifesto
Author: Atul S Gawande

- There are a 1000 ways that things can go wrong
- We like to think of ourselves as in control
-

## Necessary Fallibility
Some things we want to do are simply beyond our capacity

- We are not omniscient or all powerful
- Much of the world and universe is-and-will remain outside our understanding and control


- We have just two reasons that we may nonetheless fail:
	- ignorance
	- ineptitude


- The balance of ignorance and ineptitude has shifted greatly
- Getting the steps right is proving brutally hard even if you known them
- Know-how and sophistication have increased remarkably across almost all our realms of endeavor
- Failures of ignorance we can forgive
- Everyday there is more and more to manage and get right and learn
- Our failures persist despite remarkable individual ability
- We have accumulated stupendous know-how which is often unmanageable.
- Knowledge has both saved us and burdened us
- The volume and complexity of what we know has exceeded our individual ability to deliver its benefits correctly, safely or reliably.
- Extreme complexity is the rule for almost everyone.
- Even specialization has begun to seem inadequate.
- The level of preparation has not been enough for the new complexity.
- There are degrees of complexity beyond the usual kind
- Expertise is not enough.
- Errors and oversights occur.


-
- Checklists not only offer the possibility of verification but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance.
- Checklists remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit.
- Checklists established a higher standard of baseline performance.
- Checklists helped with memory recall and clearly set out the minimum necessary steps in a process.
- A Checklist is an easy and logical thing to try.
- Checklists proved dramatically valuable.
- Preparation is the chief difficulty.
- Checklists provide a kind of cognitive net to catch mental flaws inherent in all of us



- Mental flaws are flaws of 
	- memory
	- attention 
	- thoroughness


- Expertise is valuable but most certainly not sufficient
- The outcomes of complex problems remain highly uncertain
- Checklists can provide protection against elementary errors.
- Make sure to get the stupid stuff right.
- Ensure you have the right knowledge in hand. Ensure you apply this knowledge correctly.
- There's often no textbook formula for the problems that come up.

# The Paradox of Choice
Author: Barry Schwartz

## The Paradox of choice - a roadmap
  - Negaitve liberty: freedom from constraint, freedom from being told what to do by others
  - Positive liberty: freedom to the availability of opportunities to be the author of your life and to make it meaningful and significant
  - Negative liberty => freedom from
  - Positive liberty => freedom to
  - #Not all choices enhances freedom#
  - impair freedom
  - Many people are feeling less and less satisfied even as their freedom of choice expands
  - Instead of being fetishistic about freedom of choice, we should ask ourselves whether it nourishes us deprives us
    whether it makes us mobile or hems us in
    whether it enhances self-respect or diminishes it
  - Freedom of choice => core value
  - We do ourselves no favor when we equate liberty too directly with choice, as if we necessarily increase freedom by increasing the no of options available.
  - Liberty !== Choice
  - We make the most of our freedoms by learning to make good choices about the things that matter,
    while at the same time unburdening ourselves from too much concern about the things that don't
  - The range of chioces people face everyday has increased in recent years
  - How we choose and how difficult and demanding it is to make wise choices
  - Maximizers => individuals determined to make only the best choices
  - How and why choice can make us suffer
  - #Increased opportunities for choice actually make people not happier#
  - Added options do not make people better off
  - adaptation, regret, missed opportunities, raised expectations - feelings of inadequacy in comparison with others
  - Increased choice may actually contribute to the recent epidemic of clinical depression
  - A series of recommendation for taking advantage of what is positive and avoiding what is negative in our modern freedom of choice
  - The important lessons to be learned are not so obvious and counterintuitive

 - We would be better off
   - if we embraced certain voluntary constraints on our freedom of choice, instead of rebelling against them
   - seeking what was "good enough" instead of seeking the best
   - if we lowered our expectations about the results of decisions
   - if the decisions we made were non-reversible
   - if we paid less attention to what others around us were doing
 - Conventional wisdom is wrong at least when it comes to what satisfies us in the decisions we make.

### What It Means to Choose
  - #Everything in life is a choice#
  - Every second of every day, we are choosing, and there are always alternatives.
  - Existence, at least human existence is defined by the choices people make.
  - We face more choices and more decisions today than every before.
  - There is little psychological reality to this freedom of choice.
  - The burden of having every activity be a matter of deliberate and conscious choice would be too much for any of us to bear.
  - The transformation of choice in modern life is that choice in many facets of life has gone from implicit and often psychologically unreal to 
    explicit and psychologically very real.
  - We now face a demand to make choices that is unparalleled in human history.
  - We probably would be deeply resentful fi someone tried to take our freedom of choice away in any part of life that we really cared about and 
    really knew something about.
  - If it were up to us to choose whether or not to have choice, we would opt for choice almost every time.
  - #The cumulative effect of the added choices is causing substantial distress#

## Choice and Happiness

## Missed Opportunities

## If only, the problem of Regret
- Any time you make a decision and it doesn't turn out well or you find an alternative that would have turned out better, 
  you are candidate for regret
- **Postdecision regret**: Regret that occurs after we have experienced the results of a decision
- **Anticipated regret**: Regret that rears its head even before a decision is made
- Postdecision regret is sometimes referred to as "buyer's remorse"
- The only way to be sure that you won't regret a decision is by making the best possible decision.
### Omission bias
- Omission bias - a bias to downplay omissions (failures to act) when we evaulate the consequences of our decisions
- We don't close the **psychological door** on the decisions we have made, and as time passes, what we've failed to do looms larger and larger.
### Near Misses
- A second factor affecting regret is that how close we come to achieving our desired result.
- When you miss your objective by a lot, it is hard to imagine that small differences would have led to a successful result.
- The Nearness effect
### Responsibility of results

## What to do about choice?

### Choose When to Choose

### Be a Chooser, Not a Picker

### Satisfice More and Maximize Less
  - Learning to accept good enough will simplify decision making and increase satisfaction
  - Admittedly, there are often times when it is difficult to embrace "good enough"
  - Nonetheless, everybody satisfices in at least some areas of life, because even for the most fastidious,
    it's impossible to be a maximizer about everything.
  - The trick is to learn to embrace and appreciate satisficing, to cultivate it in more and more aspects
    of life, rather than merely being resigned to it.
  - Knowing what's good enough requires knowing yourself and what you care about. So
    - Think about occasions in life when you settle, comfortably, for "good enough";
    - Scrutinize how you choose in those areas
    - Then apply that strategy more broadly

### Think About the Opportunity Costs of Opportunity Costs
  - When making a decision, it's usually a good idea to think about the alternatives we will pass up when
		choosing our most-preferred option.
	- Ignoring these "opportunity costs" can lead us to overestimate how good the best option is.
	- There is no obvious absolute standard that we can appeal to, so some amount of reflection
		on opportunity costs is probably essential.
	- You'll encounter plenty of new things anyway.
	- #You'll stumble onto improvements on your habitual choices without going looking for them.#

### Make Your Decisions Nonreversible
  - #What we don't realize is that the very option of being allowed to change our minds seems
		to increase the chances that we will change our minds.#
	- When we can change our minds about decisions, we are less satisifed with them.
	- When a decision is final, we engage in a variety of pyschological processes that
		enhance our feelings about the choice we made relative to the alternatives.

	- If a decision is reversible, we don't engage these processes to the same degree.

	- #The power of nonreversible decisions comes through most clearly when we think about our most important choices.
		
	- Agonizing over and wondering whether you could have done better is a prescription for misery.

### Practice an "Attitude of Gratitude"
  - Our evaluation of our choices is profoundly affected by what we compare them with,
		including comparisons with alternatives that exist only in our imaginations.
	- The same experience can have both delightful and disappointing aspects.
	- #Gratitude does not come naturally to most of us most of the time.#
	- When life is not too good, we think a lot about how it could be better.
	- When life is going well, we tend not to think much about how it could be worse.
	- #Habits of thought die hard#

### Regret Less
  - The sting of Regret (either actual or potential) colors many decisions and sometimes
		influences us to avoid making decisions at all.
	- #Our experience of life would be infinitely happier if we could let go of regret#
	- Although regret is often appropriate and instructive, when it becomes so pronounced that it
		poisons or even prevents decisions, we should make an effort to minimize it.
	- We can mitigate regret by:
		- Adopting the standards of a satisficer rather than a maximizer
		- Reducing the number of options we consider before making a decision
		- Practicing gratitude for what is good in a decision rather focusing on our
			disappointments with what is bad

### Anticipate Adaptation
  - #We adapt to almost everything we experience with any regularity.#
	- We can't prevent adaptation
	- Learning to be satisfied as pleasures turn into mere comforts will ease disappointment
		with adaptation when it occurs.
	- To be better prepared for, and less disappointed by adaptation:
		- Acknowledge that the thrill won't be quite the same two months after you own it.
		- Spend less time looking for the perfect thing (maximizing), so that you won't have
			huge search costs to be amortized against the satisfaction you derive from what you actually chose
		- Remind yourself of how good things actually are instead of focusing on how they're
			less good than they were at first

### Control Expectations
  - Our evaluation of experience is substantially influenced by how it compares with our expectations.
	- #The easiest route to increasing satisfaction with the results of decisions is to remove
		excessively high expectations about them#
	- To make the task of lowering expectations easier:
		- Reduce the number of options you consider
		- Be a satisficer than a maximizer
		- Allow for serendipity

### Curtail Social Comparison
  - We evaluate the quality of our experiences by comparing ourselves to others.
	- Social comparison often reduces our satisfaction
	- Social comparison seems sufficiently destructive to our sense of well-being that
		it is worthwhile to remind ourselves to do it less.
	- It is easier for a satisficer to avoid social comparison than for a maximizer
	- Learning that "good enough" is good enough may automatically reduce concern with how others are doing
	- #Focus on what makes you happy, and what gives meaning to your life#

### Learn to Love Constraints
  - As the number of choices we face increases, freedom of choice eventually becomes
		a tyranny of choice.
	- Choice within constraints, freedom within limits, is what enables to imagine a
		host of marvelous possibilities.

* Look: How to pay attention in a distracted world
Author: Christian Madsbjerg

The importance of paying attention to our world, and observing what's happening
around us.

** Hyper-reflection
 - The kind of close observation can be taught.
 - But we have to ditch our prejudices
 - We have  learn to see beyond the obvious, and start paying attention to things
   that are going on amid the "hurly burly" of life.
 - The best observers are thoughtful and rarely rush to conclusions


 - How we can pay attention without assumptions and prejudices
 - Modernity was leaving them behind
 - There is one caveat to learning to observe and receiving insights: it takes patience and *analytical rigour*
 - *When we pay attention, new understanding will almost always emerge*

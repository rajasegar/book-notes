* Self-Reliance
Ralph Waldo Emerson - 1841

- Man is his own star
- In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty
- latent conviction
- To believe your own thought
- To believe that what is time for you in your private heart is true for all men
- The inmost in due time becomes the outmost
- **Envy is ignorance**
- *Imitation is suicide*
- The wide universe if full of good
- *Trust thyself*
- Accept the place the divine providence has found for you
- advancing on chaos and the dark
- transcendant destiny
- The man is clapped into jail by his consciousness
- Self reliance is the aversion of conformity
- the healthy attitude of human nature
- Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members
- *If malice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy, shall that pass?*
- Nothing is atlast sacred but the integrity of your own mind
- Absolve you to yourself and you shall have the suffrage of the world
- Your goodness must have some edge to it, else it is none.
- Speak the rude truth in all ways
- Go upright and vital
- Good and bad are but names readily transferable to that or this
- the education at college of fools
- I do not wish to expiate, but live
- *My life is for itself, and not for a spectacle*
- I cannot consent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right
- I actually do not need for my assurance any secondary testimony
- *Do your work and I shall know you*
- What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think
- the emptiest affectation
- The great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude
- Why drag about this corpse of your memory?
- It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone
- *A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds*
- With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do
- *To be great is to be misunderstood*
- We pass for what we are
- Character teaches above our wills
- Your conformity explains nothing
- a visible escort of angels
- The man must be so much, that he must make all circumstances indifferent
- Our imagination plays us false
- The aboriginal self on which a universal reliance may be grounded
- the formation of action and thought
- Spontaneity or instinct is essence of genius, of virtue, and of life
- Thoughtless  people do not distinguish between perception and notion
- Time and space are but physiological colors which the eye makes
- The centuries are conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul
- the universal miracle
- History is impertinence and an injury
- *Man postpones or remembers, he does not live in the present*
- *If we live truly we shall see truly*
- *The way, the thought, the good shall be wholly strange and new*
- I must be myself
- I will have no covenants but proximities
- the eternal law
- I cannot sell my liberty and my power, to save their sensibility
- All persons have this moments of reason
- The bold sensualist will use the name of philosophy to gild his crimes
- If our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart
- Most natures are insolvent
- the rugged battle of fate
- With the exercise of self trust, new powers shall appear
- The hidden meaning of good lies in our endeavours
- Our valors are our best gods
- Every new mind is a new classification
- Do that which is assigned to you and you cannot hope too much or date too much
- Travelling is a fool's paradise
- Every man is a unique
- The intellect is vagabond
- Our system of education fosters restlessness
- *Insist on your self, never imitate*
- *That which each man can do best, none but his Maker can teach him*
- For everything that is given, something is taken
- The civilized man has built a coach, but has lost the use of his feet.
- The arts and inventions of each period are only its costume and does not invigorate men
- *The great genius returns to essential man*
- Cause and effect are the chancellors of God
- *Don't believe in favorable events*
- Don't give into adversity
- Don't trust in prosperity
- *Nothing can bring you peace but yourself*
- Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles

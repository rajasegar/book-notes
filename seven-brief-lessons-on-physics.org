* Seven Brief Lessons on Physics
Author: Carlo Rovelli

** Preface
 - the most beautiful of theories => general theory of relativity
 - quantum mechanics => where the most baffling aspects of modern physics lurk
 - Cosmos => the architecture of the universe which we inhabit
 - *Science shows us how to better understand the world*
 - *Science also reveals to us just how vast is the extent of what is still not known*
 - *The extent of the unknown is vast*
 - integral and vital aspect of our culture

** The Most Beautiful of Theories
 - You don't get anywhere by not wasting time
 - There are absolute masterpieces which move us intensely
 - To fully appreciate their brilliance may require a long apprenticeship,
	 but the reward is sheer beauty
 - The reward of appreciating absolute masterpieces is the opening of our
	 eyes to a new perspective upon the world
 - The Earth is round and turns like a mad spinning top
 - Another veil has fallen
 - *Reality is not as it appears to us*
 - *Everytime we glimpse a new aspect of reality, it is a deeply emotional experience*
 - a stroke of pure genius
 - It is a moment of enlightenment
 - A momentous simplification of the world
 - We are not contained within an invisible rigid infrastructure
 - We are immersed in a gigantic flexible snailshell
 - Planets circle around the sun, and things fall, because space curves.
 - Space curves where there is matter
 - a phantasmagorical succession
 - It is not only space curves, time does too
 - The whole of space can expand and contract
 - a glimpse of reality
 - our clouded quotodian dreaming
 - our blurred and banal everyday view of reality
 - Space and gravitational field are the same thing
 - The reward is sheer beauty and new eyes with which to see the world

** Quanta
 - The fine structure of nature is more subtle than it appears
 - General relativity is a simple and coherent vision of gravity, space and time
 - quanta => packets or lumps of energy
 - Light is made of packets; particles of light => photons
 - Electrons do not always exist
 - An electron is a set of jumps from one interaction to another
 - *God has not designed reality with a line that was heavily scored, but just
	 jotted it with a faint outline
 - The whole of chemistry emerges from a single equation
 - In quantum mechanics, no object has a definite position, except when
	 colliding head long with something else
 - the courage to think the unthinkable
 - Time is not universal
 - Space is curved
 - the essential reality of a system is undescribable
 - We must accept the idea that reality is only interaction
 - *Our knowledge grows in real terms*
 - an extraordinary deep dive into the nature of reality
 - 

** The Architecture of the Cosmos
 - Before experiments, measurements, mathematics and rigorous deductions, science is above all about visions
 - *Science begins with a vision*
 - the strange quantum nature of matter
 - *Scientific thought is fed by the capacity to see things differently than they have previously been seen*
 - Sun => an infinitesimal spec in a vast cloud of 100 billion stars
 - taking up an idea already considered in antiquity
 - The world has now become a uniform and boundless expanse
 - the universe furrowed by great waves
 - The universe began as a small ball and then exploded to its present cosmic dimensions

** Particles
 - elementary particles
	 - electrons
	 - quarks
	 - photons
	 - gluons
 - minuscule moving wavelets
 - *A world of happenings, not things*
 - The fields that form the world are subject to minute fluctuations
 - *There is no such thing as a real void, one that is completely empty*
 - The world is a continuous restless swarming of things
 - A continuous coming to light and disappearance of ephemeral entities
 - A set of vibrations
 - piecemeal and patched together
 - Renormalization works in practice but leaves a bitter taste in the mouth of anyone desiring
	 simplicity of nature
 - *Physics is not only a history of successes*
 - A handful of types elementary particles vibrate and fluctuate constantly between existence and non-existence
	 and swarm in space even when it seems that there is nothing there

** Grains of Space
 - Physics provide a better description of the world than we have ever had in the past, despite
	 - certain obscurities
	 - infelicities and
	 - still unanswered questions
 - *There is a paradox at the heart of our understanding of the physical world.*
 - General relativity: the world is a curved space where everything is continuous
 - Quantum mechanics: the world is a flat space where quanta of energy leap
 - The effort to synthesize has in the past been rewarded with great strides forward in our understanding
 - Universal gravity => Galileo's parabola and ellipses of Kepler
 - A physicist is only too happy when he finds a conflict of this kind between successful theories;
	 it's an extraordinary opportunity
 - *Space is not an inert box, but rather something dynamic*
 - *Change is ubiquitous*
 - The passage of time is internal to the world
 - The illusion of space-time which continues around us is a blurred vision of this swarming of elementary processes
 - infinitesimal points do not exist
 - Matter cannot really have collapsed to an infinitesimal point
 - A Planck star should be constituted by this extreme state of matter
 - A black hole is a rebouncing star seen in extreme slow motion
 - *Physics open windows through which see far into the distance*
 - Big Bang => Big Bounce
 - The realm of quantum gravity => time and space have disappeared altogether
 - What we see doesn't cease to astonish us
 - *We are full of prejudices*
 - *Our intuitive image of the world is partial, parochial and inadequate*

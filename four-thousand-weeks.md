## Introduction: In the Long Run, We're all dead
 - The average human lifespan is absurdly, terrifyingly and insultingly short.
 - The brevity of life to be the defining problem of human existence.
 - We have been granted the mental capacities to make almost infinitely ambitious plans, yet practically
   no time at all to put them into action.
 - We will all be dead by any minute - Thomas Nagel
 - Time management is all life is.
 - The pressure to fit ever-increasing quantities of activity into a stubbornly non-increasing quantity of daily time.
 - A failure to make the best use of a small supply of time.
 - **Time seems to speed up as you age**
 - Our time and attention are so limited and therefore valuable
 - Our relationship to our limited time has always been a difficult one.
 - Time divided us, even more than it had before
 - So many of us ar so bad at managing our limited time.
 - Our efforts to make the most of our limited time don't simply fail but regularly seem to make things worse.
 - For years now, we have been deluged with advice on living the fully optimised life.
 - Time feels like an *unstoppable conveyor belt*, bringing us new tasks as fast as we can dispatch the one ones.
 - Time is like an obstreperous toddler, the more you struggle to control it, to make it conform to your agenda,
   the further it slips from you control.
 - Even the relatively previliged among us rarely get round to doing the right things.
 - busyness becomes an emblem of prestige
 - the busyness of the better-off is contagious
 - yearning for more meaning
 - Our struggle to stay on top of everything may serve someone's interests
 - The day will never arrive when you finally have everything under control
 - *Productivity is a trap*
 - Nobody in the history of humanity has ever achieved work-life balance, whatever that might be.
 - Let's start by admitting defeat.
 - Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed.


## Part I: Choosing to choose

### The Limit-Embracing life
  - the real problem is not our limited time
  - the real problem is that we have unwittingly inherited and feel pressured to live by, a troublesome set of ideas
    about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse.
  - a troublesome sort of ideas

#### Time Before Timetables
  - Our modern way of thinking about time is so deeply entrenched that we forget it even is a way of thinking
  - *There is no sense in racing towards some hypothetical moment of completion*
  - Task orientation => The rhythms of life emerge organically from the tasks themselves, rather than from being lived
    up against an abstract timeline.
  - We still occasionally encounter islands of deep time today
  - living in deep time

#### The End of Eternity
  - A threshold has been crossed.
  - Before, time was just the medium in which life unfolded
  - hypercompetitive economic climate
  - most judicious use of your time
  - *The manner most of us were brought up: to prioritise future benefits over current enjoyments*

#### Confessions of a Productivity Geek
  - the dictatorship of the clock
  - The trouble with attempting to master your time, is that time ends up mastering you
  - Experience 'deep time' - that sense of timeless time which depends on forgetting abstract yard stick and plunging back 
    into the vividness of reality instead
  - Rather than face our limitations, we engage in avoidance strategies, in an effort to carry on feeling limitless
  - Once you become convinced that something you have been attempting is impossible, it's a lot harder to keep on beating yourself for failing.
  - Most of us invest a lot of energy, one way or another in trying to avoid fully experiencing the reality in which we find ourselves.
  - What life was really demanding from me might involve surrendering the craving for mastery and diving into the unknown instead.
  - The details differ from person to person, but the kernel is the same.
  - Fear was part of the deal
  - This life with all its flaws and inescapable vulnerabilities its extreme brevity and our limited influence over how it unfolds is the only one
    we will get a shot at.
  - We mentally fight against the way things are
  - constrained by reality
  - *Tough choices are inevitable*
  - Our troubled relationship with time arises largely from the same effort to avoid the painful constraints of reality
  - *Denying reality never works*
  - It's painful to confront how limited your time is.
  - It's also painful to accept your limited control over the time you get.
  - We fill  our minds with busyness and distraction to numb ourselves emotionally
  - We push ourselves harder, chasing fantasies of the perfect work-life balance
  - *Hard choices are unavoidable. What matters is learning to make them consciously*
  - Deciding what to focus on and what to neglect.
  - facing the way things truly are
  - a limit-embracing attitude
    
#### An Icy Blast of Reality
  - At the very least, you can stop beating yourself up for failing
  - *You teach best what you most need to learn*
  - Missing out on something - indeed on almost everything is basically guaranteed.
  - *Eigenzeist - the time inherent to a process itself*
  - *What matters is learning to make hard choices consciously*
  - Stand firm in the face FOMO - Fear of Missing Out
  - *Missing out is what makes our choices meaningful in the first place*
  - Time pressure comes largely from sources outside ourselves
  - However privileged or unfortunate your specific situation, fully facing the reality of it can only help.
  - You can face the facts
  - You are no longer befogged and bewildered by a false and misleading illusion about your life.
  - You can stop buying into the delusion
  - The unfashionable but powerful notion of letting time use you approaching life as a matter of responding to the
    needs of your place and your moment in history
  - *Fulfillment might lie in embracing, rather than denying.*
  - Whereas once you deeply grasp that they are impossible, you'll be newly empowered to resist them, and to focus instead  on building
    the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you are in.

### The Efficiency Trap
- We rarely stop to consider things so rationally, through, because that would mean confronting
  the painful truth of our limitations
- Technically, it is irrational to feel troubled by an overwhelming todolist
- Sisyphus's Inbox
- There's no reason to believe you'll ever feel on top of things, or make time for everything that matters,
  simply by getting more done
- It's that the underlying assumption is unwarranted
- The path of embracing your limits
- *What matters is subjective*
- *Parkinson's Law*: Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion
- Email:
  - input side: essentially infinite
  - output side: strictly finite
- Rendering yourself more efficient won't generally result in the feeling of having enough time
- The goal-post shifting effect
- *Efficiency trap*: the demands will increase to offset any benefits
- We are often obliged to find ways to cram more into the same amount of time, even if we end up feeling busier as a result.
- *Focus on doing a few things that count*
- The only route to psychological freedom is to let go of the limit-denying fantasy of getting it all done
  and instead focus on doing a few things that count
- *Existential overwhelm*: The modern world provides an inexhaustible supply of things that seem worth doing,
  and unabridgeable gap between what you would ideally like to do and what you actually do
- what you would ideally like to do vs what you actually do
- *People try to quell their anxieties by cramming their lives with experience*
- Stuffing your life with pleasurable activities so often proves less satisfying than you'd expect.
- *The world has an effectively infinite number of experiences to offer.*
- The technologies we use to try to "get on top of everything" always fails us, in the end,
  because they increase the size of the "everything" of which we are trying to get on top.
- Stop clearing the decks
- Ironic result => You end up with more to do
- *The more efficient you get, the more you become a limitless reservoir for other people's expectations.*
- In reality your time is finite
- Doing anything requires sacrifice
- The sacrifice of all the other things you could have been doing with that stretch of time
- Never had to clear the hurdle of being judged more important than something else
- The important ones got postponed - either forever or until an imminent deadline forced me to complete them, 
  to a mediocre standard and in a stressful rush.
- One can waste years this way, systematically postponing precisely the things one cares about the most.
- Focus instead on what's truly of greatest consequence
- You will no longer be operating under the illusion of one day making time for everything.
- You get to focus on fully enjoying the tiny slice of experinces you actually do have time for.
- A willingness to resist such urges
- Life gets subtly worse

#### The Pitfalls of Convenience
- In attempting to eliminate only the tedious experiences, we accidentally end up eliminating things we
  didn't realize we valued until they were gone.
- Smoothness is a dubious virtue
- *It's often the unsmoothed textures of life that make it liveable*
- Convenience colonizes everyday life
- Convenience culture reduces us into imagining that we might find room for everything important
  by eliminating only life's tedious tasks.
- The undodgeable reality of a finite human life is that you are going to have to choose


### Facing Finitude
- You can't delve far into the question of what it means to be a finite human being, with finite time on the planet.
- The most fundamental thing we fail to appreciate about the world: Being and Time
- Every moment of human existence is completely shot through with the fact of our "finitude"
- Our being is totally, utterly bound up with our finite time
- We are a limited amount of time
- A decision to do any given thing will automatically mean sacrificing an infinite number of potential alternative paths.
- **Any finite life is therefore a matter of ceaselessly waving goodbye to possibility.**
- *Finitude defines our life*
- The only real question about all this finitude is whether we're willing to confront it or not.
- Living a truly authentic life is facing up to the fact.
- We must live out our lives, to whatever extent we can, in clear-eyed acknowledgement of our limitations,
  in the undeluded mode of existence.
- *Life is not a dress rehearsal. Every choice requires myriad sacrifices*
- It is only by facing our finitude that we can step into a truly authentic relationship with life.
- Eternity would be deathly dull.
- By only learning how to die, we only learn how to live.
- It's by consciously confronting the certainty of death, and what follows from the certainty of death, that
  we finally becomes truly present for our lives.
- 

#### Thrown into Time

#### Getting Real
- Things certainly do get realer when you deeply grasp the fact that you're going to die and that therefore
 your time is severely limited.
- From an everyday standpoint, the fact that life is finite feels like a terrible insult, a sort of personal affront.

#### Everything is borrowed time
- Why assume that an infinite supply of time is the default, and mortality the outrageous violation?
- a vital bit of perspective
- Matters are liable to look very different indeed.
- *Being alive is just happenstance, and not one more day of it is guaranteed.*
- The crucial and basic question of choosing what to do with your limited time.
- It's a fact of life, that as a finite human, you are always making hard choices
- Each moment of decision becomes an opportunity to select from an enticing menu of possibilities
- it stops making sense to pity yourself for having been cheated of all the other options
- *Your whole life is borrowed time*
- You can embrace the fact that you are forgoing certain pleasures or neglecting certain obligations.
- *Joy of Missing Out (JOMO)* - The exhilaration that sometimes arises when you grasp this truth about finitude.


### Becoming a Better Procrastinator
- We need to learn to get better at procrastinating
- *Procrastination of some kind is inevitable*
- The core challenge of managing our limited time is not about how to get everything done, but to how to 
  decide most wisely what not to do.
- *Good procrastination*: Accepts the fact that you can't get everything done, then decides as wisely as possible
  what tasks to focus on and what to neglect
- *Bad procrastination*: finds yourself paralyzed precisely because you can't bear the thought of confronting your limitations
- The point is not to eradicate procrastination, but to choose more wisely what you're goint to procrastinate on, in order to focus on what matters
- The real measure of any time management technique  is whether or not it helps you neglect the right things.
- The critical question is not how to differentiate between activities that matter and those that don't, but what to do when far too many things feel atleast somewhat important
- *Pay yourself first when it comes to time*
- We are terrible at long-range planning
- You get to preserve your sense of being in control of things, but at the cost of never finishing anything important
- Limit your work-in-progress
- Fix a hard upper limit on the no of things  that you can allow yourself to work on at any given time.
- Banish the habit of keeping an ever proliferating number of half-finished projects on the back-burner
- Your capacity for work is strictly finite
- **Working on everything at once simply wasn't an option**
- **Break down your projects into manageable chunks**
- Resist the allure of middling priorities.
- **Most of us need to get better at learning to say no**
- It's all too easy to assume that this merely entails finding the courage to decline various tedious things
  you never wanted to do in the first place
- **Face the truth about your finitude and make your choices accordingly** 
- You need to learn how to start saying no to things you don't want to do,
  with the recognition that you have only one life
- We fail to see or refuse to accept that any attempt to bring our ideas into
  concrete reality must inevitably fall short of our dreams, no matter how
  brilliantly we succeed in carrying things off.
- **Reality has limitations and unpredictability**
- Reality is a realm in which we don't have limitless control
- If you're procrastinating on something because you are worried you 
  won't  do a good enough job, you can relax.
- Some people do commit outwardly to a relationship but hold back from
  full emotional commitment on the inside


#### The Art of Creative Neglect

#### Perfection and Paralysis

#### The Inevitability of Settling
- JOMO => the recognition that the renunciation of alternatives is what makes their choice a meaningful one in the first place
- When you can no longer turn back, anxiety falls away
- Now there's only one direction to tracel: forward into the consequences of your choice


### The Watermelon Problem
- What you pay attention to, will define, for you, what reality is
- Attention just is life
- A systematic inner failure to use one's time on what one claimed to value the most
- Your experience of being alive consists of nothing other than the sum of everything to which you pay attention
- In succumbing to diversions, they were squandering the very shift of existence
- Attention is the beginning of devotion
- Distraction and care are incompatible with each other
- The only faculty you can use to see what's happening to your attention is your attention, the very thing that's alreay been commandeered
- We are distracted from  distraction by distraction
- Your finite time has been appropriated , without you realizing anything's amiss
- Political crises demand political solutions
- We have to understand distraction at the deepest level
- The most insidious of the obstacles we face in our efforts to sue our finite lives well
- **Much of the time we give into distraction willingly**
- 

### The Intimate Interrupter
- You are obliged to gice up your godlike fantasies and to experience your lack of power over things you are care about
- The real problem had been not the activity itself but his internal resistance to experiencing it
- We are motivated by the desire to try to flee something painful about our experiences of the present
- When the difficult sensations are so hard to ignore that it take real effort to shift your attention elsewhere
- You are eager the slightest excuse to turn away from what you are doing, in order to escape how disagreeable it feels to be doing it.
- **Intimate Interrupter**: inner urge towards distraction - self within self
- **We are rendered so uncomfortable by concentrating on things that matter**
- **Boredom often arises without explanation**
- Whenever we succumb to distraction, we are attempting to flee a painful encounter with our finitude
- When you try to focus on something you deem important, you are forced to face your limits
- **Boredom is an intense reaction to the deeply uncomfortable experience of confronting your limited control**
- Boredom can feel so surprisingly, aggressively unpleasant
- **Face your finitude**
- You will have had to allow yourself to risk feeling claustrophobic, imprisoned, powerless and constrained by reality
- The strategies generally recommended for defeating distraction rarely work or at least not for long
- You will probably still find it unpleasantly constraining to focus on what matters
- What we think of distractions are not the ultimate cause of our being distracted
- The most effective way to sap distraction of its power is to stop expecting things to be otherwise
- Accept that this upleasantness is simply what it feels like for finite humans
- Confront our limited control over how our lives unfold
- There is a sense in which accepting the lack of any solution is the solution
- **Acknowledge the inevitability of discomfort**
- Turn more of your attention to the reality of your situation than to railing against it.
- **You don't get to dictate the course of events**
- The paradoxical reward for accepting reality's constraints is that they no longer feel so constraining
- The entirety of human suffering can be boiled down to this effort  to resist paying full attention to the way things are going
- We wish we felt more in control of the process
- There is a very down-to-earth kind of liberation in grasping that there are certain truths about being a limited
  human from which you will never be liberated.

## Part II: Beyond Control
- **Hofstadter's Law**: Any task you are planning to tackle will always take longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law
- The standard advice about planning could actually make matters worse
- The activities we try to plan fr somehow actively resist our efforst to make them conform to our plans

### We Never Really have time
- **Reality seems to fight back**
- The obsessive planner, essentially is demanding certain reassurances from the future
- The future is not the sort of thing that can ever provide the reassurance
- No matter how far ahead you plan, you never get to relax in the certainty that everything is going to go the way you would like
- **The fontier of your uncertainty just gets pushed further and further towards the horizon**
- Worry at the core is the repetitious experience of a mind attempting to generate a feeling of security about the future, failing than trying again and again
- the importance of confronting, rather than avoiding the uncomfortable reality about how little time we have
- The fuel behind worry is the internal demand to know in advance that things will turn out fine
- **You can never be truly certain about the future**
- And so your reach will always exceed your grasp
- Our efforst to influence the future are not the problem, the problem is the need we feel from our  vantage point here in 
  the present moment to be able to know that those efforst will prove successfull
- Our expectations are forever running up against the stubborn reality that time is not our posession and can't be brought under our control
- **The struggle for certainty is an intrinsically hopeless one**
- It's a recipe for a life of unending stress to insist that your must be able to feel certain
- **You can't know that things will turn out all right**
- A surprising effective antidote to anxeity can be to simply realize that this demand for reassurance from the future is one that
  will definitely never be satisfied.
- If you peer back even further in time, it's an even more dizzying matter of coincidence piled upon coincidence
- the mind boggling nunber of things
- Despite our total lack of control over any of these occurrences, each of us made it through to this point in our lives
- thanks to circumstances you never chose
- **Do not rule over imaginary kingdoms of endlessly proliferating possibilities**
- Take no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought  for the things of itself
- I don't mind what happens
- A life spent not minding what happens is one lived without the inner demand to know that the future will conform to your desires for it
- Planning is an essential tool for constructing a meaningful life and for exercising  our responsibilities towards other people
- **The real problem is that we take our plans for something they are not**
- The future ofcouse is under no obligation to comply
- **All a plan is a present-moment statement of intent**
- Inevitably we become obsessed with using time well
- It turns out to be perilously easy to over-invest  in this instrumental relationship to time

### You are Here
- **The unfortunate truth**: The more you focus on using time well, the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through.
- You find yourself living mentally in the future
- We are all frequently guilty of something similar
- We treat eveything we are doing, life itself, as valuable only inso far as it lays the groundwork for something else
- We are treating the present solely as a path to some superior future state and so the present moment won't ever feel satisfying in itself
- Modernity had corrupted the purity of parenthood
- Obviously it matters to keep half an eye on the future
- hypothetical future sense of security and peace of mind
- A child's purpose is to be a child
- **Nature does not disdain what only lives for a day. It pours the whole of itself in each moment.**
- **Life's bounty is in its flow, Later is too late**
- **Life is a succession of transient experiences**, valuable in themselves which you will miss if you are completely focused on 
  the destination to which you hope they might be leading.
- Indeed, there is a sense in which every moment of life is a last time
- We approach our finite time in such a pereversely instrumental and future-focused way
- Our lives, thanks to their finitude, are inevitably full of activities that we are doing for the very last time.
- **We exist inside an economic system that is instrumentalist to its core**
- Capitalism is a great machine for instrumentalising everything it encounters
- Rich people in capitalist economies are often surprisingly miserable
- a future state of happiness
- have difficulty grasping a non-commoditized understanding of the meaning of time
- We choose to treat time in this self-defeatingly instrumental way and we do so because it helps us maintain
  the feeling of being in omnipotent control of our lives.
- **The moment of truth is always now**
- Life is nothing but a succession of present moments
- **Throw yourself into life now**
- Our fixation of purposiveness is ultimately motivated by the desire not to die
- The purposive man is always tring to secure a spurious and delusive immortality for his actions by pushing his
  interests in them forward into time
- The purposive man get to imagine himself an omnipotent god, whose influence over reality extends infinitely off into the future
- You are so fixated on trying to make the best use of your time
- finding absorption in the most mundane of activities
- The attempt to be here now feels not so much relaxing as rather strenuous
- Trying to have the most intense possible present-moment experience is a surefire way to fail
- The life of this moment has no outside
- Living more fully in the present may be simply a matter of finally realizing you never had any other option but to be here now
- To try to live in the moment implies that you are somehow separate from the moment and thus in a position to either succeed or fail at living in it
- **Purposiveness**: using time well for future purposes
- The attempt to  be here now is therefore still another instrumentalist attempt to use the present moment purely as a means to an end
- We cannot get anything out of life
- There is no outside where we can take life into

### Rediscovering Rest

### The Impatience spiral

### Staying on the Bus
- In a world geared for hurry, the capacity to resist the urge to hurry is a way to gain purchase on the world
- accustomed to a life of speed
- You don't have much choice but to let the work in question takes its time
- **The presence of problems in your life is not impediment to a meaningful existence, but the very substance of one**
- ultra-competitive atmosphere
- There is nothing passive or resigned about the kind of patience that arises from this effort to resist the urge to hurry
- Grumpiness gives way to fatigue, then restless irritation
- Time slows and sags
- Grumpiness -> Fatigure -> Restless irritation
- You finally give up attempting to escape the discomfort of time passing so slowly and the discomfort abates
- of really getting stuck into life
- The experience of patience is tangible, almost edible, as if it gives things a kind of chewiness - into which you can sink your teeth
- Your reward for surrendering the fantasy of controlling the pace of reality is to achieve, at last, a real sense of purchase on that reality
- Patience is not merely a more peaceful and present-oriented way to live but a concretely useful skill
- transformative experience of surrendering to the speed of reality
- If you are willing to endure the discomfort of not knowing, a solution will often present itself.
- We are made so uneasy by the experience of allowing reality to unfold at its own speed that when we are faced with a problem, it feels
  better to race towards a resolution
- Once you give up on the unattainable goal of eradicating all your problems, it becomes possible to develop an appreciation for the 
  fact that life is just a process of engaging with problem after problem
- **Life is just a process of engaging with problem after problem**
- Most of us treat the problems we encounter as doubly problematic
- **Unspoken fantasy** => You might one day finally reach the state of having no problems whatsoever
- The state of having no problems is never going to arrive
- **There is nothing called an unproblematic state**
- A life devoid of all problems would contain nothing worth doing and would therefore be meaningless
- Critical aspect of radical incrementalist approach => be willing to stop when your daily time is up, 
  even when you are bursting with energy and feel as though you could much more done.
- Stopping helps strengthen the muscle of patience that will permit you to return to the project again, 
  and thus to sustain your productivity over an entire career
- **Stay on the bus, stay on the fucking bus**
- The distinctive work begins at all only for those who can muster the patience to immerse themselves in the earlier stage - 
  the trial-and-error phase of copying others learning new skills and accumulating experience
- the kinds of meaningful and singular accomplishments that just take the time they take

### The Loneliness of the Digital Nomad

### Cosmic Insignificance Therapy

### The Human Disease

### 10 tools for Embracing your finitude
 - Adopt a fixed volume approach to productivity
 - Serialize, serialize, serialize
 - Decide in advance what to fail at
 - Focus on what you have already completed, not just what is left to complete
 - Consolidate your caring
 - Embrace boring and single purpose technology
 - Seek out novelty in the mundane

- Tough choices are inevitable
- Seek out novelty in the mundane
- Denying reality never works
- Pay yourself first

## 3 rules of thumb especially useful for harnessing the power of patience as a creative force
    - Develop a taste for having problems
    - Embrace radical incrementalism
    - Originality lies on the far side of unoriginality




- *Broken fantasy* => you might one day finally reach the state of having no problems whatsoever

- The state of having no problems is obviously never going to arrive

- A life devoid of all problems would contain nothing worth doing and would therefore be meaningless.

- The presence of problems in your life is not an impediment to a meaningful existence, but the very substance of one.

- The presence of problems in your life is the very substance of a meaningful existence.

- Life is just a process of engaging with problem after problem

- Critical aspect of radical incrementalist approach -> to be willing to stop when your daily time is up, even
when you are bursting with energy and feel as though you could get much more done

- Stopping helps strengthen the muscle of patience that will permit you to return to the project again,
and thus to sustain your productivity over an entire career.

- Stay on the bus, stay on the fucking bus.

- The distinctive work begins at all only for those who can muster the patience to immerse themselves in the earlier stage -
the trial-and-error phase of copying others, learning new skills and accumulating experience.

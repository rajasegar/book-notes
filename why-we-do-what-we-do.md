## Authority and its Discontents
 - **Control is an easy answer**
 - **Dissenting opinions deserve to be heard**
 - Allow yourself to fail and you will be more likely to succeed
 - Authenticity necessitates behaving autonomously
 - Conformity is the expression of people's tendency to comply
 - The key to understanding autonomy, authenticity and self is the psychological process called integration
 - The qualities of freedom and flexibility that characterize autonomy and authenticity
 - **Integration is a defining aspect of the self**
 - Rebellion is the outward manifestion of people's tendency to defy controls.
 - Rebellion coexists uneasily with conformity
 - Narcissm involves desperately seeking affirmation from others.
 - Narcissm is not the result of authenticity or self-determination
 - Authenticity cannot be understood in terms of outward behaviours alone.
 - People never cease struggling to find their own voice.
 - **Self-motivation is at the heart of creativity, responsibility, healthy behavior and lasting change.**
 - It is harder to find active workers who in a meaningful sense are their own masters.
 - Promoting human autonomy and responsibility
 - With compliance comes various negative consequences including the urge to defy
 - Neither compliance nor defiance exemplifies autonomy and authenticity
 - The most powerful motivation leading to the most responsible behavior must come from within
 - How can people create the conditions within which others will motivate themselves?
 - **Choice is the key to self-determination and authenticity**
 - intrpsychic processes
 - People can regulate themselves in quite autonomous and authentic ways
 - the incredible emphasis on instrumental thinking
 - **Instrumental Thinking** = seeing everything as a means to an end
 - The efficient causation of behavior => antecedent events force one to behave

## THE IMPORTANCE OF AUTONOMY AND COMPETENCE

### I'm only in it for the Money: Early Experiments on Rewards and Alienation

### The Need for Personal Autonomy
 - Intrinsic motivation could be undermined by extrinsic rewards
 - People have needs of the mind as well as needs of the body
 - This is rather subtle point, but it's significance is quite profound
 - maladaptive consequences
 - People threaten others all the time and they assume that it's an effective motivational strategy
 - autonomy vs control
 - Limit setting is important, but an over emphasis on control and discipline seems to be off the mark
 - It's not always easy to provice choice
 - Providing choice, in the broad sense of that term is a central feature in supporting a person's autonomy
 - The main thing about meaningful choice is that it engenders willingness
 - When choice is offered, it's essential that the person being offered choice have the information necessary
   for making a meaningful decision
 - The impact of the reward should depend on how the person interprets it.
 - To experience a sense of choice, you need to know the possibilities, the constraints and the hidden features
 - Offering rewards in a non-controlling way requires a kind of deep honesty that often eludes people.
 - Rewards often have negative, though unintended consequences that the advocates are usually not willing to acknowledge
 - Rewards might ensure certain behaviours
 - The adults are really using the rewards to pressure the children
 - **Competition does not necessarily undermines intrinsic motivation but it is a quite delicate matter**
 - How can we avoid being permissive without creating a gridlock?
 - Autonomy support !== control
 - Autonomy support is being able to take the other person's perspective and work from there.
 - **Being autonomy supportive can be more difficult**
 - Autonomy support => actively encouraging:
   - self-initiation
   - experimentation
   - responsibility
 - controlling way => conventional
 - non-controlling way => autonomy supportive way
 - It is possible to encourage responsibility without undermining authenticity
 - The autonomy supportive condition seemed to have liberating effect
 - The controlling condition have a debilitating effect

### Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation: The Yields of Each
  - The experience of Intrinsic motivation is its own justification
  - **Modern society has the malaise of instrumental reason**
  - Every true work of art is backed by intrinsic motivation
  - Motivation is the key to success in education
  - The strategy of giving tests is not necessarily productive if the objective is long-term learning
  - Learning will be greater when prompted by intrinsic motivation rather than external controls
  - controlling limits vs autonomy supportive limits

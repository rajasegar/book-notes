* The Beginning of Infinity
Author: David Deutsch

Explanations that transform the world

** Introduction
- All progress has resulted from a single human activity, the quest for good explanations.
- Much progress is unbounded.
- Although progress has no necessary end, it does have a necessary beginning.
-
** The Reach of Explanations
- The universe is seething with violent activity.
- Explanations:- assertions about what is out there and how it behaves
- Learning from experience => choose between theories
- inductive inference => general from the peculiar
- Scientific explanations are about reality.
- For if one cannot derive predictions from experience, one certainly cannot derive explanations.
- Since inductivism is false, empiricism must be as well.
- The sens*e cannot be deceptive in themselves.
- What misleads us are only the false interpretations that we place on appearances.
- Justification !== Fallibilism
- Fallibilism is essential for the initiations of unlimited knowledge growth - the beginning of infinity.
- *All observations are theory-laden, and hence fallible, as all our theories are*.
- conjecture - theoretical interpretation
- *We perceive nothing as what it really is*.
- *There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.*
- cimenti = trials by ordeal
- Appearances are not self-explanatory
- *Prediction is not and cannot be the purpose of science*.
- Explanation is a statement of the reality that accounts for the appearance.
- There is no such thing as a purely predictive, explanationless theory.
- *Knowledge that is both familiar and uncontroversial is background knowledge.*
- *Solving a problem means creating an explanation that does not have the conflict.*
- Conflicting ideas in a broader sense are the occasion for all rational thought and inquiry.
- Expectations are theories too.
- There are no contradictions in reality.
- *Every problem signals that our knowledge must be flawed or inadequate*.
- We are born with ideas and with the ability to make progress by changing them.
- Explanation plays the central role in science.
- Prediction alone is insufficient.
- Science is what we have learned about how to keep from fooling ourselves. - Richard Feynman
- Good explanations are often strikingly simple or elegant.
- Removing superfluous features and arbitrariness yields a good explanation.
- Virtually all human attempts to explain experience in terms of a wider reality have indeed been fiction.
- The maxim of testability promotes the growth of knowledge in science.

- The maxim of testability promotes the growth of knowledge in science.
- A good explanation makes it harder for you to fool yourself
- The better an explanation is, the more rigidly its reach is determined.
- Ideas were static for long periods
- We need explanations to survive
- Apperances are deceptive
